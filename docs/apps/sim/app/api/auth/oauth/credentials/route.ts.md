This TypeScript file defines an API endpoint (`GET` handler for a Next.js API route) responsible for fetching OAuth credentials. It's a robust endpoint that supports various ways of identifying the credentials needed: by a specific credential ID, by an OAuth provider type, and importantly, it handles access control in the context of user-owned credentials versus credentials associated with a workflow.

### Purpose of this File and What it Does

At its core, this file serves as a **secure API endpoint to retrieve OAuth account information (credentials)** stored in the application's database. This information is crucial for other parts of the system that need to interact with third-party services on behalf of a user (e.g., Google, GitHub).

Here's a breakdown of its primary functions:

1.  **Authentication and Authorization:** It verifies that the user making the request is authenticated and has the necessary permissions to access the requested credentials. This includes checking if a user can access credentials linked to a specific workflow they might not directly own but have permissions for via a workspace.
2.  **Flexible Credential Retrieval:** It can fetch:
    *   A specific credential by its unique ID.
    *   All credentials for a given OAuth provider (e.g., all "Google Drive" credentials) belonging to the requesting user or a workflow owner.
3.  **Context-Aware Access:** It intelligently determines *who* owns the credentials based on whether a `workflowId` is provided, ensuring that users can only access credentials they are authorized for.
4.  **Data Transformation:** It takes raw account data from the database and transforms it into a more user-friendly format, including a display name (like an email address) for easy identification.
5.  **Robust Error Handling:** It provides clear error messages for various failure scenarios, such as unauthenticated requests, missing parameters, or forbidden access.

In essence, it's the gatekeeper for OAuth credentials, ensuring secure and flexible access to third-party service connections.

### Detailed Explanation

Let's break down the code line by line, or in logical blocks, explaining its purpose and complexity.

#### Imports

```typescript
import { db } from '@sim/db'
import { account, user, workflow } from '@sim/db/schema'
import { and, eq } from 'drizzle-orm'
import { jwtDecode } from 'jwt-decode'
import { type NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { checkHybridAuth } from '@/lib/auth/hybrid'
import { createLogger } from '@/lib/logs/console/logger'
import type { OAuthService } from '@/lib/oauth/oauth'
import { parseProvider } from '@/lib/oauth/oauth'
import { getUserEntityPermissions } from '@/lib/permissions/utils'
import { generateRequestId } from '@/lib/utils'
```

*   `import { db } from '@sim/db'`: Imports the Drizzle ORM database client instance, which is used to interact with the application's database.
*   `import { account, user, workflow } from '@sim/db/schema'`: Imports schema definitions for the `account`, `user`, and `workflow` tables. These are Drizzle ORM table objects used to construct database queries.
*   `import { and, eq } from 'drizzle-orm'`: Imports Drizzle ORM utility functions.
    *   `and`: Used to combine multiple conditions in a `WHERE` clause with a logical AND.
    *   `eq`: Used to create an equality condition (e.g., `column = value`).
*   `import { jwtDecode } from 'jwt-decode'`: Imports a utility function to decode JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). This is used later to extract information like email from OAuth `idToken`s.
*   `import { type NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'`: Imports types and classes from Next.js server utilities.
    *   `NextRequest`: Represents the incoming HTTP request.
    *   `NextResponse`: Used to construct and send the HTTP response.
*   `import { checkHybridAuth } from '@/lib/auth/hybrid'`: Imports a custom authentication utility. This function likely handles various authentication methods (e.g., session, API key, internal JWT) to determine the requesting user's identity.
*   `import { createLogger } from '@/lib/logs/console/logger'`: Imports a custom logger factory to create a logger instance for this specific module, aiding in debugging and monitoring.
*   `import type { OAuthService } from '@/lib/oauth/oauth'`: Imports a TypeScript type definition, `OAuthService`, which likely enumerates the supported OAuth providers (e.g., 'google', 'github', 'google-drive'). This is used for type safety when handling provider names.
*   `import { parseProvider } from '@/lib/oauth/oauth'`: Imports a utility function to parse a provider string (e.g., `'google-default'`) into its base provider (`'google'`) and potentially a feature type (`'default'`).
*   `import { getUserEntityPermissions } from '@/lib/permissions/utils'`: Imports a utility function to check user permissions for specific entities (like a workspace). This is crucial for access control.
*   `import { generateRequestId } from '@/lib/utils'`: Imports a utility to generate a unique request ID, useful for tracing individual requests through logs.

#### Configuration and Utilities

```typescript
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'

const logger = createLogger('OAuthCredentialsAPI')

interface GoogleIdToken {
  email?: string
  sub?: string
  name?: string
}
```

*   `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`: This is a Next.js specific export. It forces this API route to be dynamically rendered on each request, preventing it from being statically optimized or cached at build time. This is often necessary for routes that handle authentication or frequently changing data.
*   `const logger = createLogger('OAuthCredentialsAPI')`: Initializes a logger instance specifically named `'OAuthCredentialsAPI'`. This allows logs generated within this file to be easily identified as originating from this part of the application.
*   `interface GoogleIdToken { email?: string; sub?: string; name?: string }`: Defines a TypeScript interface for the structure of a decoded Google ID token. It specifies optional properties like `email`, `sub` (subject, usually a user ID), and `name`, which are expected to be found in Google's JWTs. This helps with type safety when decoding tokens.

#### GET Handler Function

```typescript
/**
 * Get credentials for a specific provider
 */
export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  const requestId = generateRequestId()

  try {
    // ... logic ...
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error(`[${requestId}] Error fetching OAuth credentials`, error)
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Internal server error' }, { status: 500 })
  }
}
```

*   `export async function GET(request: NextRequest)`: This is the main entry point for the API route. In Next.js, an exported `GET` function handles HTTP GET requests to this route. It's an `async` function because it performs asynchronous operations like database queries and authentication checks. It receives a `NextRequest` object containing details about the incoming request.
*   `const requestId = generateRequestId()`: Generates a unique ID for the current request. This `requestId` is then included in all logs for this request, making it much easier to trace specific interactions through the system.
*   `try { ... } catch (error) { ... }`: This is a standard `try...catch` block for error handling. If any error occurs within the `try` block, execution jumps to the `catch` block.
    *   `logger.error(...)`: Logs the error with the `requestId` for context.
    *   `return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Internal server error' }, { status: 500 })`: Sends a generic "Internal server error" response with a 500 HTTP status code, preventing sensitive error details from being exposed to the client.

#### Extracting Query Parameters

```typescript
    // Get query params
    const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url)
    const providerParam = searchParams.get('provider') as OAuthService | null
    const workflowId = searchParams.get('workflowId')
    const credentialId = searchParams.get('credentialId')
```

*   `const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url)`: Creates a `URL` object from the request's URL and extracts its `searchParams` property, which is a `URLSearchParams` object containing all query parameters.
*   `const providerParam = searchParams.get('provider') as OAuthService | null`: Retrieves the value of the `provider` query parameter (e.g., `?provider=google-drive`). It's explicitly cast to `OAuthService | null` for type safety, indicating it should be one of the defined OAuth service types or null if not present.
*   `const workflowId = searchParams.get('workflowId')`: Retrieves the value of the `workflowId` query parameter. This is an optional parameter that, if present, changes the context of credential ownership and access.
*   `const credentialId = searchParams.get('credentialId')`: Retrieves the value of the `credentialId` query parameter. This is an optional parameter used to fetch a *specific* credential by its unique ID.

#### Authentication Check

```typescript
    // Authenticate requester (supports session, API key, internal JWT)
    const authResult = await checkHybridAuth(request)
    if (!authResult.success || !authResult.userId) {
      logger.warn(`[${requestId}] Unauthenticated credentials request rejected`)
      return NextResponse.json({ error: 'User not authenticated' }, { status: 401 })
    }
    const requesterUserId = authResult.userId
```

*   `const authResult = await checkHybridAuth(request)`: Calls the `checkHybridAuth` utility to authenticate the incoming request. This function likely checks for various forms of authentication tokens (e.g., session cookies, API keys in headers, internal JWTs) and returns a result indicating success or failure, along with the authenticated `userId`.
*   `if (!authResult.success || !authResult.userId)`: Checks if the authentication was successful and if a `userId` was resolved.
*   `logger.warn(...)`: If authentication fails, a warning is logged.
*   `return NextResponse.json(...)`: An error response with status 401 (Unauthorized) is returned to the client.
*   `const requesterUserId = authResult.userId`: If authentication is successful, the ID of the user who made the request is stored. This is important for identifying who is trying to access credentials.

#### Resolving Effective User ID (Complex Logic Explained)

This section is crucial for access control. It determines whose credentials are being requested. It's not always the `requesterUserId` because a user might be accessing credentials tied to a workflow owned by someone else, provided they have the right permissions.

```typescript
    // Resolve effective user id: workflow owner if workflowId provided (with access check); else requester
    let effectiveUserId: string
    if (workflowId) {
      // Load workflow owner and workspace for access control
      const rows = await db
        .select({ userId: workflow.userId, workspaceId: workflow.workspaceId })
        .from(workflow)
        .where(eq(workflow.id, workflowId))
        .limit(1)

      if (!rows.length) {
        logger.warn(`[${requestId}] Workflow not found for credentials request`, { workflowId })
        return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Workflow not found' }, { status: 404 })
      }

      const wf = rows[0]

      if (requesterUserId !== wf.userId) {
        if (!wf.workspaceId) {
          logger.warn(
            `[${requestId}] Forbidden - workflow has no workspace and requester is not owner`,
            {
              requesterUserId,
            }
          )
          return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Forbidden' }, { status: 403 })
        }

        const perm = await getUserEntityPermissions(requesterUserId, 'workspace', wf.workspaceId)
        if (perm === null) {
          logger.warn(`[${requestId}] Forbidden credentials request - no workspace access`, {
            requesterUserId,
            workspaceId: wf.workspaceId,
          })
          return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Forbidden' }, { status: 403 })
        }
      }

      effectiveUserId = wf.userId
    } else {
      effectiveUserId = requesterUserId
    }
```

*   `let effectiveUserId: string`: Declares a variable to store the ID of the user whose credentials should be accessed. This will either be the `requesterUserId` or the owner of a specified workflow.
*   `if (workflowId)`: This block executes if the `workflowId` query parameter was provided, indicating the request is for credentials associated with a specific workflow.
    *   `const rows = await db.select(...).from(workflow).where(eq(workflow.id, workflowId)).limit(1)`: Queries the database to fetch the `userId` (owner) and `workspaceId` of the specified `workflow`. This is essential for determining access rights.
    *   `if (!rows.length)`: If no workflow is found for the given `workflowId`, a 404 (Not Found) error is returned.
    *   `const wf = rows[0]`: Extracts the found workflow data.
    *   `if (requesterUserId !== wf.userId)`: This is the core access control check. If the requesting user is *not* the owner of the workflow:
        *   `if (!wf.workspaceId)`: Checks if the workflow is associated with a workspace. If a workflow *doesn't* have a workspace, only its direct owner can access its credentials. In this case, if the requester is not the owner, it's a 403 (Forbidden) error.
        *   `const perm = await getUserEntityPermissions(requesterUserId, 'workspace', wf.workspaceId)`: If the workflow *does* have a `workspaceId`, it calls `getUserEntityPermissions` to check if the `requesterUserId` has *any* permissions for that workspace. This implies that if a user has access to the workspace a workflow belongs to, they can access its credentials.
        *   `if (perm === null)`: If the requester has no permissions for the workspace, a 403 (Forbidden) error is returned.
    *   `effectiveUserId = wf.userId`: If all access checks pass (either the requester is the workflow owner, or they have workspace permissions), the `effectiveUserId` is set to the workflow owner's ID.
*   `else { effectiveUserId = requesterUserId }`: If `workflowId` was *not* provided, the request is simply for the `requesterUserId`'s own credentials, so `effectiveUserId` is set to `requesterUserId`.

#### Input Validation for Provider/Credential ID

```typescript
    if (!providerParam && !credentialId) {
      logger.warn(`[${requestId}] Missing provider parameter`)
      return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Provider or credentialId is required' }, { status: 400 })
    }
```

*   `if (!providerParam && !credentialId)`: This check ensures that the client has provided at least one of `provider` or `credentialId` in the query parameters. Without either, the API wouldn't know which credentials to fetch. If both are missing, a 400 (Bad Request) error is returned.

#### Parsing the Provider

```typescript
    // Parse the provider to get base provider and feature type (if provider is present)
    const { baseProvider } = parseProvider(providerParam || 'google-default')
```

*   `const { baseProvider } = parseProvider(providerParam || 'google-default')`: Calls `parseProvider` to extract the "base" provider name (e.g., `'google'` from `'google-default'`). The `|| 'google-default'` provides a fallback default if `providerParam` is not present, ensuring `parseProvider` always gets a string, though in the case where `credentialId` is present and `providerParam` isn't, `baseProvider` might not be directly used for filtering but is useful for display name logic later.

#### Fetching Accounts Data from Database

This section retrieves the actual OAuth account records based on the `effectiveUserId` and whether a specific `credentialId` or `providerParam` was specified.

```typescript
    let accountsData

    if (credentialId) {
      // Foreign-aware lookup for a specific credential by id
      // If workflowId is provided and requester has access (checked above), allow fetching by id only
      if (workflowId) {
        accountsData = await db.select().from(account).where(eq(account.id, credentialId))
      } else {
        // Fallback: constrain to requester's own credentials when not in a workflow context
        accountsData = await db
          .select()
          .from(account)
          .where(and(eq(account.userId, effectiveUserId), eq(account.id, credentialId)))
      }
    } else {
      // Fetch all credentials for provider and effective user
      accountsData = await db
        .select()
        .from(account)
        .where(and(eq(account.userId, effectiveUserId), eq(account.providerId, providerParam!)))
    }
```

*   `let accountsData`: Declares a variable to hold the array of raw account records fetched from the database.
*   `if (credentialId)`: If a `credentialId` was provided, the aim is to fetch a single specific account.
    *   `if (workflowId)`: If a `workflowId` was *also* provided (and access was already verified in the `effectiveUserId` section), the lookup can be purely by `credentialId`. This allows a user with workflow access to fetch *any* credential ID associated with that workflow, regardless of its `userId` in this specific query (because the `effectiveUserId` check implicitly ensures ownership by the workflow owner).
        *   `accountsData = await db.select().from(account).where(eq(account.id, credentialId))`: Fetches the account record directly by its `id`.
    *   `else`: If `credentialId` is present but `workflowId` is *not*, the request is for the `effectiveUserId`'s *own* specific credential.
        *   `accountsData = await db.select().from(account).where(and(eq(account.userId, effectiveUserId), eq(account.id, credentialId)))`: Fetches the account record by both `userId` and `id`, ensuring the credential belongs to the `effectiveUserId`.
*   `else`: If `credentialId` was *not* provided, the request is to fetch all credentials for a given `providerParam`.
    *   `accountsData = await db.select().from(account).where(and(eq(account.userId, effectiveUserId), eq(account.providerId, providerParam!)))`: Fetches all account records that belong to the `effectiveUserId` AND match the `providerParam` (e.g., all 'google-drive' accounts for that user). The `!` asserts that `providerParam` will not be null here because of the earlier validation.

#### Transforming Accounts into Credentials (Complex Logic Explained)

This section processes the raw database records (`accountsData`) and converts them into a more structured and client-friendly `credentials` array. The most complex part is determining a user-friendly `displayName`.

```typescript
    // Transform accounts into credentials
    const credentials = await Promise.all(
      accountsData.map(async (acc) => {
        // Extract the feature type from providerId (e.g., 'google-default' -> 'default')
        const [_, featureType = 'default'] = acc.providerId.split('-')

        // Try multiple methods to get a user-friendly display name
        let displayName = ''

        // Method 1: Try to extract email from ID token (works for Google, etc.)
        if (acc.idToken) {
          try {
            const decoded = jwtDecode<GoogleIdToken>(acc.idToken)
            if (decoded.email) {
              displayName = decoded.email
            } else if (decoded.name) {
              displayName = decoded.name
            }
          } catch (_error) {
            logger.warn(`[${requestId}] Error decoding ID token`, {
              accountId: acc.id,
            })
          }
        }

        // Method 2: For GitHub, the accountId might be the username
        if (!displayName && baseProvider === 'github') {
          displayName = `${acc.accountId} (GitHub)`
        }

        // Method 3: Try to get the user's email from our database
        if (!displayName) {
          try {
            const userRecord = await db
              .select({ email: user.email })
              .from(user)
              .where(eq(user.id, acc.userId))
              .limit(1)

            if (userRecord.length > 0) {
              displayName = userRecord[0].email
            }
          } catch (_error) {
            logger.warn(`[${requestId}] Error fetching user email`, {
              userId: acc.userId,
            })
          }
        }

        // Fallback: Use accountId with provider type as context
        if (!displayName) {
          displayName = `${acc.accountId} (${baseProvider})`
        }

        return {
          id: acc.id,
          name: displayName,
          provider: acc.providerId,
          lastUsed: acc.updatedAt.toISOString(),
          isDefault: featureType === 'default',
        }
      })
    )
```

*   `const credentials = await Promise.all(accountsData.map(async (acc) => { ... }))`: This uses `Promise.all` with `Array.prototype.map` to concurrently process each `acc` (account record) in `accountsData`. Since some display name methods involve `await`ing database calls, `Promise.all` efficiently handles these asynchronous transformations.
    *   `const [_, featureType = 'default'] = acc.providerId.split('-')`: Splits the `providerId` (e.g., `'google-default'`, `'google-drive'`) by the hyphen. The first part is ignored (`_`), and the second part is taken as `featureType`. If there's no hyphen, `featureType` defaults to `'default'`. This helps distinguish between different "features" of the same base provider.
    *   `let displayName = ''`: Initializes an empty string to store the user-friendly name for the credential.
    *   **Method 1: Extract from ID Token:**
        *   `if (acc.idToken)`: Checks if the account record has an `idToken` (common for OpenID Connect providers like Google).
        *   `try { const decoded = jwtDecode<GoogleIdToken>(acc.idToken); ... } catch (_error) { ... }`: Attempts to decode the `idToken` using `jwtDecode`. The `GoogleIdToken` interface ensures type safety for the decoded payload.
        *   `if (decoded.email) { displayName = decoded.email } else if (decoded.name) { displayName = decoded.name }`: Prioritizes the `email` field from the token, then falls back to `name`.
        *   The `catch` block logs a warning if token decoding fails but doesn't block the process.
    *   **Method 2: GitHub-specific logic:**
        *   `if (!displayName && baseProvider === 'github')`: If a `displayName` hasn't been found yet and the base provider is GitHub.
        *   `displayName = `${acc.accountId} (GitHub)``: For GitHub, the `accountId` (which is often the GitHub username) is used as a display name.
    *   **Method 3: Fetch User Email from Database:**
        *   `if (!displayName)`: If `displayName` is still empty.
        *   `try { const userRecord = await db.select(...).from(user).where(eq(user.id, acc.userId)).limit(1); ... } catch (_error) { ... }`: Attempts to fetch the email of the `userId` associated with the account directly from the `user` table in the database.
        *   `if (userRecord.length > 0) { displayName = userRecord[0].email }`: If a user record is found, their email is used as the `displayName`.
        *   The `catch` block logs a warning if fetching the user email fails.
    *   **Fallback Method:**
        *   `if (!displayName)`: If after all attempts `displayName` is still empty.
        *   `displayName = `${acc.accountId} (${baseProvider})``: A generic fallback is used, combining the `accountId` (a technical ID) and the `baseProvider` name.
    *   `return { id: acc.id, name: displayName, provider: acc.providerId, lastUsed: acc.updatedAt.toISOString(), isDefault: featureType === 'default' }`: Finally, for each account, an object is returned with its ID, the determined `displayName`, the full `providerId`, the `updatedAt` timestamp (formatted as ISO string) as `lastUsed`, and a boolean `isDefault` based on the `featureType`.

#### Sending the Response

```typescript
    return NextResponse.json({ credentials }, { status: 200 })
```

*   `return NextResponse.json({ credentials }, { status: 200 })`: If everything is successful, a JSON response is sent back to the client. The response body contains an object with a `credentials` array, and the HTTP status code is 200 (OK).

---

### Simplification of Complex Logic

The most complex parts are:

1.  **Effective User ID Resolution:** Instead of simply fetching credentials for the user making the request, the code first figures out *whose* credentials are truly relevant.
    *   **Scenario A (No Workflow ID):** You want to see *your own* Google Drive credentials. The `effectiveUserId` is simply `yourUserId`.
    *   **Scenario B (With Workflow ID):** You're working on a workflow. This workflow was created by "Alice" but is in a workspace you have access to. You need to use Alice's credentials for that workflow. The code first checks if you're Alice (the owner). If not, it checks if the workflow belongs to a workspace and if you have *any* permissions on that workspace. If yes, then `effectiveUserId` becomes `Alice'sUserId`. This allows for delegated access within a team or project.
2.  **Display Name Generation:** Getting a user-friendly name for an OAuth account (like "your@email.com" instead of "10234567890") is not straightforward. The code attempts multiple strategies in a specific order:
    *   **First Choice (Best):** Try to get the email or name directly from the OAuth provider's `idToken` (if available, common for Google). This is usually the most accurate and descriptive.
    *   **Second Choice (Provider-Specific):** For providers like GitHub, the raw `accountId` might already be a username, so it's used with a context label.
    *   **Third Choice (Database Lookup):** If the above fail, try to find the email of the user *who owns the credential* in our own `user` database table.
    *   **Fallback (Last Resort):** If all else fails, use the raw, technical `accountId` combined with the base provider name.

This layered approach ensures that the credentials presented to the client are as identifiable and useful as possible, while also handling edge cases where richer information might not be available.

In summary, this API endpoint is a well-designed piece of infrastructure that prioritizes security, flexibility, and user experience when dealing with external service connections.
