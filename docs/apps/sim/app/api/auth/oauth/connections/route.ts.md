This TypeScript file defines a Next.js API route that retrieves and displays a user's connected OAuth (Open Authorization) accounts, such as "Login with Google" or "Sign in with GitHub." It acts as an endpoint where a frontend application can fetch a list of all external services the current user has linked to their profile.

The core idea is to transform raw database records about connected accounts into a user-friendly structure, providing details like the service name, connected email/username, and connection status.

---

## Simplified Overview

At its heart, this API route does the following:

1.  **Authenticates the User**: It first checks if a user is logged in. If not, it denies the request.
2.  **Fetches Data**: It queries the database for all `account` records associated with the logged-in user. These `account` records represent individual connections to external providers (e.g., one record for "Google," another for "GitHub"). It also fetches the user's primary email from the `user` table as a fallback.
3.  **Processes Connections**: It then iterates through each `account` record:
    *   It extracts the *type* of provider (e.g., 'google', 'github') and any specific *feature* (e.g., 'email' for Google).
    *   It tries to determine a user-friendly *display name* for the connection. For instance, it might decode a Google ID token to get the user's email, or use the GitHub username from the `accountId`, or fall back to the user's primary email.
    *   It groups multiple accounts from the *same specific provider configuration* (e.g., if a user has two Google accounts linked via the same `providerId`) into a single connection entry, listing the individual accounts under it.
4.  **Returns Formatted Data**: Finally, it returns a JSON object containing an array of these structured connections, or an error if something goes wrong.

## Detailed Line-by-Line Explanation

Let's break down the code in detail:

```typescript
import { account, db, user } from '@sim/db'
import { eq } from 'drizzle-orm'
import { jwtDecode } from 'jwt-decode'
import { type NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { getSession } from '@/lib/auth'
import { createLogger } from '@/lib/logs/console/logger'
import { generateRequestId } from '@/lib/utils'
```

*   **`import { account, db, user } from '@sim/db'`**:
    *   This line imports database-related objects from a local package `@sim/db`.
    *   `account`: Refers to the Drizzle ORM schema definition for the `account` table, which typically stores details about a user's connected OAuth accounts (e.g., `providerId`, `providerAccountId`, `userId`, `access_token`, `id_token`).
    *   `db`: This is the Drizzle ORM database instance itself, used to perform queries.
    *   `user`: Refers to the Drizzle ORM schema definition for the `user` table, which stores information about the application's users.
*   **`import { eq } from 'drizzle-orm'`**:
    *   Imports the `eq` function from `drizzle-orm`. This is a Drizzle utility used to construct "equals" conditions in database queries (e.g., `WHERE column = value`).
*   **`import { jwtDecode } from 'jwt-decode'`**:
    *   Imports the `jwtDecode` function from the `jwt-decode` library. This utility is used to parse and extract information from JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) without verifying their signature (useful for getting claims from `id_token`s).
*   **`import { type NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'`**:
    *   Imports types and classes from Next.js's server-side runtime.
    *   `NextRequest`: The type definition for the incoming HTTP request object in Next.js API routes.
    *   `NextResponse`: A class used to create and return HTTP responses from Next.js API routes.
*   **`import { getSession } from '@/lib/auth'`**:
    *   Imports the `getSession` function from a local authentication utility. This function is responsible for retrieving the current user's session information.
*   **`import { createLogger } from '@/lib/logs/console/logger'`**:
    *   Imports a custom `createLogger` function from a local logging utility. This is used for creating a logger instance to log messages (warnings, errors, info) to the console or other configured destinations.
*   **`import { generateRequestId } from '@/lib/utils'`**:
    *   Imports `generateRequestId` from a local utility file. This function likely creates a unique identifier for each incoming request, which helps in tracing logs related to a specific request.

```typescript
const logger = createLogger('OAuthConnectionsAPI')
```

*   **`const logger = createLogger('OAuthConnectionsAPI')`**:
    *   Initializes a logger instance specifically for this API route, giving it the name `'OAuthConnectionsAPI'`. This helps in identifying the source of log messages.

```typescript
interface GoogleIdToken {
  email?: string
  sub?: string
  name?: string
}
```

*   **`interface GoogleIdToken { ... }`**:
    *   Defines a TypeScript interface named `GoogleIdToken`. This interface specifies the expected structure of a decoded Google ID Token.
    *   `email?: string`: An optional `email` property (the user's email address).
    *   `sub?: string`: An optional `sub` property (the subject, typically a unique user ID from the identity provider).
    *   `name?: string`: An optional `name` property (the user's full name).
    *   This interface provides type safety when working with the decoded JWT, ensuring the code expects these specific fields.

```typescript
/**
 * Get all OAuth connections for the current user
 */
export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  const requestId = generateRequestId()
```

*   **`export async function GET(request: NextRequest)`**:
    *   This defines an asynchronous function named `GET`. In Next.js, an exported `GET` function in a file like `pages/api/oauth-connections.ts` (or `app/api/oauth-connections/route.ts`) automatically becomes the handler for GET requests to that API endpoint.
    *   `request: NextRequest`: The function receives a `NextRequest` object, which contains information about the incoming HTTP request (headers, query parameters, body, etc.).
*   **`const requestId = generateRequestId()`**:
    *   Generates a unique ID for the current request. This ID is then used in log messages to easily trace all related events for a specific API call.

```typescript
  try {
    // Get the session
    const session = await getSession()

    // Check if the user is authenticated
    if (!session?.user?.id) {
      logger.warn(`[${requestId}] Unauthenticated request rejected`)
      return NextResponse.json({ error: 'User not authenticated' }, { status: 401 })
    }
```

*   **`try { ... } catch (error) { ... }`**: This block encloses the main logic to handle potential errors gracefully.
*   **`const session = await getSession()`**:
    *   Calls the `getSession()` function to retrieve the current user's session data. This typically involves reading a cookie or other session storage. Since it's an `async` function, `await` is used to pause execution until the session data is available.
*   **`if (!session?.user?.id)`**:
    *   This is an authentication check. It verifies if a session exists (`session?`), if it contains user information (`user?`), and most importantly, if the user has an `id`. If any of these are missing, it means the user is not authenticated.
    *   `logger.warn(...)`: Logs a warning message indicating an unauthenticated request.
    *   `return NextResponse.json({ error: 'User not authenticated' }, { status: 401 })`: If not authenticated, it returns an HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) status code along with a JSON error message, immediately stopping the function's execution.

```typescript
    // Get all accounts for this user
    const accounts = await db.select().from(account).where(eq(account.userId, session.user.id))

    // Get the user's email for fallback
    const userRecord = await db
      .select({ email: user.email })
      .from(user)
      .where(eq(user.id, session.user.id))
      .limit(1)

    const userEmail = userRecord.length > 0 ? userRecord[0]?.email : null
```

*   **`const accounts = await db.select().from(account).where(eq(account.userId, session.user.id))`**:
    *   This performs a database query using Drizzle ORM.
    *   `db.select()`: Starts a select query, meaning it will retrieve data.
    *   `.from(account)`: Specifies that data should be selected from the `account` table.
    *   `.where(eq(account.userId, session.user.id))`: Filters the results to only include `account` records where the `userId` column matches the `id` of the currently authenticated user from the session. This ensures only the current user's connected accounts are fetched.
    *   `await`: Pauses execution until the database query completes and the `accounts` are fetched.
*   **`const userRecord = await db.select({ email: user.email }).from(user).where(eq(user.id, session.user.id)).limit(1)`**:
    *   This is another database query, specifically to fetch the primary email of the current user.
    *   `db.select({ email: user.email })`: Selects only the `email` column from the `user` table. The `email: user.email` syntax renames the selected column to `email` in the result object for clarity.
    *   `.from(user)`: Specifies the `user` table.
    *   `.where(eq(user.id, session.user.id))`: Filters the `user` table to find the record matching the authenticated user's ID.
    *   `.limit(1)`: Ensures that at most one user record is returned, as `user.id` is expected to be unique.
    *   `await`: Pauses execution until this query finishes.
*   **`const userEmail = userRecord.length > 0 ? userRecord[0]?.email : null`**:
    *   This line extracts the email from the `userRecord` result.
    *   `userRecord` is an array of results. It checks if the array has any elements (`userRecord.length > 0`).
    *   If it does, `userRecord[0]?.email` accesses the `email` property of the first (and only) element.
    *   If no user record is found (or no email), `userEmail` is set to `null`. This email will be used as a fallback display name.

```typescript
    // Process accounts to determine connections
    const connections: any[] = []

    for (const acc of accounts) {
      // Extract the base provider and feature type from providerId (e.g., 'google-email' -> 'google', 'email')
      const [provider, featureType = 'default'] = acc.providerId.split('-')

      if (provider) {
        // Try multiple methods to get a user-friendly display name
        let displayName = ''

        // Method 1: Try to extract email from ID token (works for Google, etc.)
        if (acc.idToken) {
          try {
            const decoded = jwtDecode<GoogleIdToken>(acc.idToken)
            if (decoded.email) {
              displayName = decoded.email
            } else if (decoded.name) {
              displayName = decoded.name
            }
          } catch (_error) {
            logger.warn(`[${requestId}] Error decoding ID token`, {
              accountId: acc.id,
            })
          }
        }

        // Method 2: For GitHub, the accountId might be the username
        if (!displayName && provider === 'github') {
          displayName = `${acc.accountId} (GitHub)`
        }

        // Method 3: Use the user's email from our database
        if (!displayName && userEmail) {
          displayName = userEmail
        }

        // Fallback: Use accountId with provider type as context
        if (!displayName) {
          displayName = `${acc.accountId} (${provider})`
        }
```

*   **`const connections: any[] = []`**:
    *   Initializes an empty array named `connections`. This array will store the processed and structured OAuth connection objects that will be returned to the client. `any[]` is used here because the exact structure of connection objects is built dynamically.
*   **`for (const acc of accounts)`**:
    *   This loop iterates over each `account` record fetched from the database for the current user. `acc` represents a single account object in each iteration.
*   **`const [provider, featureType = 'default'] = acc.providerId.split('-')`**:
    *   This line parses the `providerId` from the account record. `providerId` often combines the base provider name and a specific feature (e.g., 'google-email', 'github-oauth').
    *   `acc.providerId.split('-')`: Splits the `providerId` string wherever a hyphen (`-`) appears, creating an array of strings (e.g., `['google', 'email']`).
    *   `const [provider, featureType = 'default'] = ...`: Uses array destructuring to assign the first part to `provider` (e.g., 'google') and the second part to `featureType`. If there's no second part (e.g., `providerId` is just 'github'), `featureType` defaults to `'default'`.
*   **`if (provider)`**:
    *   Ensures that a valid `provider` name was successfully extracted before proceeding.
*   **`let displayName = ''`**:
    *   Initializes an empty string `displayName`. This variable will hold a user-friendly name for the connected account (e.g., "john.doe@example.com", "octocat (GitHub)").
*   **Method 1: Extract email/name from ID token (`if (acc.idToken)`)**:
    *   `if (acc.idToken)`: Checks if the current account record has an `idToken`. ID tokens are typically JWTs issued by identity providers (like Google) containing user identity information.
    *   **`try { ... } catch (_error) { ... }`**: A `try-catch` block is used because `jwtDecode` can throw an error if the token is malformed.
    *   `const decoded = jwtDecode<GoogleIdToken>(acc.idToken)`: Decodes the `idToken` using `jwtDecode`. The `<GoogleIdToken>` type assertion helps TypeScript understand the expected structure.
    *   `if (decoded.email)`: If the decoded token contains an `email`, that's used as the `displayName`.
    *   `else if (decoded.name)`: Otherwise, if it has a `name`, that's used.
    *   `logger.warn(...)`: If decoding fails, a warning is logged with the request ID and account ID for debugging.
*   **Method 2: For GitHub, use `accountId` as username (`if (!displayName && provider === 'github')`)**:
    *   `if (!displayName && provider === 'github')`: This condition checks if `displayName` is *still empty* (meaning Method 1 didn't find a name) AND the `provider` is 'github'.
    *   `displayName = `${acc.accountId} (GitHub)``: For GitHub, `accountId` often holds the username. This line constructs a display name like "octocat (GitHub)".
*   **Method 3: Use the user's primary email (`if (!displayName && userEmail)`)**:
    *   `if (!displayName && userEmail)`: If `displayName` is *still empty* AND the `userEmail` (fetched earlier from the `user` table) is available.
    *   `displayName = userEmail`: The user's primary email is used as the `displayName`.
*   **Fallback: Use `accountId` with provider type (`if (!displayName)`)**:
    *   `if (!displayName)`: If after all previous attempts, `displayName` is *still empty*.
    *   `displayName = `${acc.accountId} (${provider})``: This provides a generic fallback using the `accountId` (which is often a unique ID from the provider) and the base `provider` name (e.g., "123456789 (google)").

```typescript
        // Create a unique connection key that includes the full provider ID
        const connectionKey = acc.providerId

        // Find existing connection for this specific provider ID
        const existingConnection = connections.find((conn) => conn.provider === connectionKey)

        if (existingConnection) {
          // Add account to existing connection
          existingConnection.accounts = existingConnection.accounts || []
          existingConnection.accounts.push({
            id: acc.id,
            name: displayName,
          })
        } else {
          // Create new connection
          connections.push({
            provider: connectionKey,
            baseProvider: provider,
            featureType,
            isConnected: true,
            scopes: acc.scope ? acc.scope.split(' ') : [],
            lastConnected: acc.updatedAt.toISOString(),
            accounts: [
              {
                id: acc.id,
                name: displayName,
              },
            ],
          })
        }
      }
    }
```

*   **`const connectionKey = acc.providerId`**:
    *   Sets `connectionKey` to the full `providerId` (e.g., 'google-email'). This is crucial because it allows grouping multiple accounts that use the *exact same provider configuration* together.
*   **`const existingConnection = connections.find((conn) => conn.provider === connectionKey)`**:
    *   This line searches the `connections` array (which holds the processed connection objects) to see if a connection object with the same `connectionKey` (i.e., same `providerId`) already exists.
*   **`if (existingConnection)`**:
    *   If a connection with this `connectionKey` already exists (meaning the user has multiple accounts linked via the *same type* of OAuth provider, e.g., two different Google accounts linked via 'google-email').
    *   **`existingConnection.accounts = existingConnection.accounts || []`**: Ensures that the `accounts` array property exists on the `existingConnection`. If it's `undefined` or `null`, it initializes it as an empty array.
    *   **`existingConnection.accounts.push({ id: acc.id, name: displayName, })`**: Adds the current account's details (its unique database `id` and the generated `displayName`) to the `accounts` array of the *existing* connection. This aggregates multiple physical database `account` records under a single logical connection entry.
*   **`else { ... }`**:
    *   If no existing connection with this `connectionKey` is found, it means this is the first time we're encountering an account for this specific `providerId`.
    *   **`connections.push({ ... })`**: A new connection object is created and pushed into the `connections` array.
        *   `provider: connectionKey`: The full `providerId` (e.g., 'google-email').
        *   `baseProvider: provider`: The base provider name (e.g., 'google').
        *   `featureType`: The extracted feature type (e.g., 'email' or 'default').
        *   `isConnected: true`: Indicates that this connection is active.
        *   `scopes: acc.scope ? acc.scope.split(' ') : []`: If the account has an associated `scope` (permissions granted, e.g., 'email profile'), it's split into an array of individual scopes; otherwise, it's an empty array.
        *   `lastConnected: acc.updatedAt.toISOString()`: The `updatedAt` timestamp from the account record, converted to an ISO string for consistent date formatting.
        *   `accounts: [{ id: acc.id, name: displayName }]`: An array containing details of the *first* account found for this `providerId`. Subsequent accounts for the same `providerId` would be added to this array by the `if (existingConnection)` block.
*   **`}` (closing `if (provider)` block)**

```typescript
    return NextResponse.json({ connections }, { status: 200 })
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error(`[${requestId}] Error fetching OAuth connections`, error)
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Internal server error' }, { status: 500 })
  }
}
```

*   **`return NextResponse.json({ connections }, { status: 200 })`**:
    *   If all processing completes successfully, this line returns an HTTP 200 (OK) status code.
    *   `NextResponse.json(...)`: Creates a JSON response. The body of the response will be an object `{ connections: [...] }`, where `connections` is the array of processed OAuth connection objects.
*   **`} catch (error) { ... }`**:
    *   This `catch` block handles any unexpected errors that might occur during the execution of the `try` block (e.g., database connection issues, other runtime errors).
    *   `logger.error(...)`: Logs the error message, including the `requestId` and the actual `error` object, which is crucial for debugging.
    *   `return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Internal server error' }, { status: 500 })`**: Returns an HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error) status code and a generic error message to the client, preventing sensitive error details from being exposed.
