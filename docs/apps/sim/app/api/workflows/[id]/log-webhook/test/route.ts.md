This TypeScript file defines a Next.js API route that allows users to *test* a configured webhook for a specific workflow. It simulates a `workflow.execution.completed` event, generates a payload, signs it (if a secret is provided), and sends it to the webhook's URL. This helps users verify that their webhook endpoint is correctly set up to receive and process events.

---

### **Detailed Explanation**

#### **1. Purpose of this File and What it Does**

This file (`src/app/api/workflows/[id]/test-webhook/route.ts`) acts as an API endpoint (`/api/workflows/[id]/test-webhook`) for a web application. Specifically, it handles `POST` requests.

**Its core purpose is to provide a testing mechanism for webhooks associated with workflows.** When a user triggers this endpoint (e.g., by clicking a "Test Webhook" button in the UI), it performs the following steps:

1.  **Authenticates and Authorizes** the user to ensure they have permission to access the specified workflow.
2.  **Retrieves** the configuration details of a specific webhook linked to that workflow.
3.  **Constructs a mock (fake) webhook payload** representing a `workflow.execution.completed` event, populating it with test data and dynamically adding fields based on the webhook's configuration (e.g., if it's set to include final output or trace spans).
4.  **Generates a cryptographic signature** for the payload (if a secret is configured for the webhook), mimicking how a real event would be signed for security and integrity verification.
5.  **Sends this mock event** as an HTTP `POST` request to the webhook's configured URL.
6.  **Records and returns the result** of this test delivery, including the HTTP status, response body, and any errors, allowing the user to troubleshoot their webhook endpoint.

In essence, it's a "dry run" or "sandbox" for webhooks, allowing developers to ensure their integration works without needing to trigger a full workflow execution.

#### **2. Simplify Complex Logic**

The most complex parts involve:

*   **Database Queries (Drizzle ORM):** The code uses `drizzle-orm` for database interactions. This is a "type-safe ORM" which means it helps you build SQL queries using TypeScript code, preventing common errors and providing autocompletion. The `and()`, `eq()`, `select()`, `from()`, `innerJoin()`, `where()` methods are building blocks for selecting, filtering, and combining data from different database tables (like `workflow` and `permissions`).
*   **Cryptographic Signature Generation (HMAC):** The `generateSignature` function creates an HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code). Think of it like a digital seal. If you have a shared secret key with the webhook receiver, you can use this key to "sign" the message. The receiver, also having the secret key, can re-generate the signature from the received message and compare it. If they match, it confirms two things:
    1.  The message hasn't been tampered with in transit.
    2.  The message genuinely came from your server (since only you and the receiver know the secret).
*   **HTTP Request with Timeout (`fetch` and `AbortController`):** When sending the test webhook, the `fetch` API is used. To prevent the API route from hanging indefinitely if the target webhook URL is slow or unresponsive, an `AbortController` is employed. This allows the `fetch` request to be cancelled after a specified duration (10 seconds in this case), ensuring a timely response to the user.

#### **3. Explain Each Line of Code Deeply**

```typescript
import { createHmac } from 'crypto'
```
*   **`import { createHmac } from 'crypto'`**: Imports the `createHmac` function from Node.js's built-in `crypto` module. This function is essential for generating cryptographic hash-based message authentication codes (HMACs), which are used to sign webhook payloads for security.

```typescript
import { db } from '@sim/db'
```
*   **`import { db } from '@sim/db'`**: Imports the database connection instance, typically configured to interact with your chosen database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL). `db` is an instance of `drizzle-orm`'s `PgDatabase` or similar, used to perform all database operations.

```typescript
import { permissions, workflow, workflowLogWebhook } from '@sim/db/schema'
```
*   **`import { permissions, workflow, workflowLogWebhook } from '@sim/db/schema'`**: Imports table schemas (definitions) from your database schema.
    *   `permissions`: Represents the database table storing user permissions for various entities (like workspaces).
    *   `workflow`: Represents the database table storing workflow definitions.
    *   `workflowLogWebhook`: Represents the database table storing the configurations for webhooks associated with workflow logging.

```typescript
import { and, eq } from 'drizzle-orm'
```
*   **`import { and, eq } from 'drizzle-orm'`**: Imports helper functions from `drizzle-orm` for building database queries.
    *   `and`: Used to combine multiple conditions in a `WHERE` clause with a logical AND operator.
    *   `eq`: Used to create an equality comparison condition (e.g., `column = value`).

```typescript
import { type NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'
```
*   **`import { type NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'`**: Imports types and classes from Next.js for handling API routes.
    *   `NextRequest`: A type representing the incoming HTTP request object in Next.js API routes.
    *   `NextResponse`: A class used to construct and return HTTP responses from Next.js API routes.

```typescript
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid'
```
*   **`import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid'`**: Imports the `v4` function from the `uuid` library, aliased as `uuidv4`. This function generates universally unique identifiers (UUIDs) compliant with RFC 4122 version 4, commonly used for creating unique IDs for events, executions, and deliveries.

```typescript
import { getSession } from '@/lib/auth'
```
*   **`import { getSession } from '@/lib/auth'`**: Imports a utility function `getSession` from a local authentication library. This function is responsible for retrieving the current user's session information, typically containing user ID and other authenticated data.

```typescript
import { createLogger } from '@/lib/logs/console/logger'
```
*   **`import { createLogger } from '@/lib/logs/console/logger'`**: Imports a function to create a logger instance from a local logging utility. This allows for structured logging of events and errors for debugging and monitoring.

```typescript
import { decryptSecret } from '@/lib/utils'
```
*   **`import { decryptSecret } from '@/lib/utils'`**: Imports a utility function `decryptSecret` from a local utility file. This function is used to decrypt sensitive information, such as webhook secrets, which are typically stored encrypted in the database.

```typescript
const logger = createLogger('WorkflowLogWebhookTestAPI')
```
*   **`const logger = createLogger('WorkflowLogWebhookTestAPI')`**: Initializes a logger instance named `WorkflowLogWebhookTestAPI`. This logger will be used throughout the file to output informational messages, warnings, and errors to the console or other configured logging destinations.

---

```typescript
function generateSignature(secret: string, timestamp: number, body: string): string {
  const signatureBase = `${timestamp}.${body}`
  const hmac = createHmac('sha256', secret)
  hmac.update(signatureBase)
  return hmac.digest('hex')
}
```
*   **`function generateSignature(secret: string, timestamp: number, body: string): string { ... }`**: Defines a helper function to generate an HMAC signature.
    *   **`secret: string`**: The secret key (shared between sender and receiver) used for signing.
    *   **`timestamp: number`**: The timestamp of the event.
    *   **`body: string`**: The JSON string representation of the webhook payload.
    *   **`const signatureBase = `${timestamp}.${body}``**: Concatenates the timestamp and the request body string, separated by a dot. This combined string is what will be hashed to create the signature. Including the timestamp helps prevent replay attacks (where an attacker re-sends an old, valid request).
    *   **`const hmac = createHmac('sha256', secret)`**: Creates an HMAC object.
        *   `'sha256'`: Specifies the hashing algorithm to be SHA-256.
        *   `secret`: Provides the secret key to the HMAC algorithm.
    *   **`hmac.update(signatureBase)`**: Feeds the `signatureBase` string into the HMAC algorithm.
    *   **`return hmac.digest('hex')`**: Computes the final HMAC digest (the signature) and returns it as a hexadecimal string.

---

```typescript
export async function POST(request: NextRequest, { params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }) {
  try {
```
*   **`export async function POST(...)`**: This defines the main asynchronous function that handles `POST` requests to this API route. In Next.js, files named `route.ts` (or `route.js`) inside an API directory automatically expose HTTP methods (like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) as exported functions.
    *   **`request: NextRequest`**: The incoming HTTP request object, provided by Next.js.
    *   **`{ params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }`**: This is a destructuring assignment to get route parameters.
        *   `params`: An object containing dynamic route segments. In this case, `[id]` in the route path `/api/workflows/[id]/test-webhook` corresponds to `params.id`. Since `params` is a `Promise`, it needs to be awaited to get the actual `id`.
    *   **`try { ... }`**: A `try...catch` block to handle any potential errors that might occur during the execution of this function, ensuring a graceful response to the client.

```typescript
    const session = await getSession()
    if (!session?.user?.id) {
      return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 })
    }
```
*   **`const session = await getSession()`**: Calls the `getSession` utility to retrieve the current user's authenticated session. This function is `async` because session retrieval might involve database lookups or external API calls.
*   **`if (!session?.user?.id) { ... }`**: Checks if a session exists and if it contains a user ID.
    *   `session?.user?.id`: Uses optional chaining (`?.`) to safely access nested properties without throwing an error if `session` or `session.user` is `null`/`undefined`.
    *   **`return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 })`**: If no valid user ID is found in the session, it means the user is not logged in or their session is invalid. An `Unauthorized` JSON response with an HTTP status code `401` is returned.

```typescript
    const { id: workflowId } = await params
    const userId = session.user.id
    const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url)
    const webhookId = searchParams.get('webhookId')
```
*   **`const { id: workflowId } = await params`**: Destructures the `params` object (after awaiting it) to extract the `id` property and renames it to `workflowId` for clarity. This `workflowId` comes from the dynamic part of the URL (`/api/workflows/[id]/...`).
*   **`const userId = session.user.id`**: Extracts the `id` of the currently authenticated user from the session object.
*   **`const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url)`**: Creates a `URL` object from the incoming request's URL string. It then destructures `searchParams` to easily access query parameters.
*   **`const webhookId = searchParams.get('webhookId')`**: Retrieves the value of the `webhookId` query parameter from the URL (e.g., `?webhookId=abc`).

```typescript
    if (!webhookId) {
      return NextResponse.json({ error: 'webhookId is required' }, { status: 400 })
    }
```
*   **`if (!webhookId) { ... }`**: Checks if the `webhookId` query parameter was provided.
*   **`return NextResponse.json({ error: 'webhookId is required' }, { status: 400 })`**: If `webhookId` is missing, returns a `Bad Request` JSON response with HTTP status code `400`, indicating that a required parameter was not supplied.

```typescript
    const hasAccess = await db
      .select({ id: workflow.id })
      .from(workflow)
      .innerJoin(
        permissions,
        and(
          eq(permissions.entityType, 'workspace'),
          eq(permissions.entityId, workflow.workspaceId),
          eq(permissions.userId, userId)
        )
      )
      .where(eq(workflow.id, workflowId))
      .limit(1)
```
*   **`const hasAccess = await db ...`**: This is a database query using Drizzle ORM to check if the `userId` has access to the specified `workflowId`.
    *   **`.select({ id: workflow.id })`**: Specifies that we only want to select the `id` column from the `workflow` table.
    *   **`.from(workflow)`**: Starts the query from the `workflow` table.
    *   **`.innerJoin(...)`**: Joins the `workflow` table with the `permissions` table. This means only rows where a match is found in *both* tables based on the `on` condition will be included.
        *   **`permissions`**: The table to join with.
        *   **`and(...)`**: Combines multiple conditions for the join.
            *   **`eq(permissions.entityType, 'workspace')`**: Ensures the permission is for a `workspace` entity.
            *   **`eq(permissions.entityId, workflow.workspaceId)`**: Links the permission to the `workspaceId` that the `workflow` belongs to. This implies permissions are managed at the workspace level.
            *   **`eq(permissions.userId, userId)`**: Checks if the permission is granted to the current `userId`.
    *   **`.where(eq(workflow.id, workflowId))`**: Filters the results to only include the specific workflow identified by `workflowId`.
    *   **`.limit(1)`**: Limits the query to return at most one result. We only need to know if *any* matching permission exists, not all of them.
*   **Simplified Logic**: This query effectively asks: "Does the current user (`userId`) have *any* permission on the workspace that this `workflowId` belongs to?"

```typescript
    if (hasAccess.length === 0) {
      return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Workflow not found' }, { status: 404 })
    }
```
*   **`if (hasAccess.length === 0) { ... }`**: Checks if the `hasAccess` query returned any results.
*   **`return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Workflow not found' }, { status: 404 })`**: If `hasAccess.length` is 0, it means either the workflow doesn't exist, or the user does not have permission to access it. A `Not Found` JSON response with status code `404` is returned (often used instead of `403 Forbidden` for security reasons, to avoid leaking information about existing resources).

```typescript
    const [webhook] = await db
      .select()
      .from(workflowLogWebhook)
      .where(
        and(eq(workflowLogWebhook.id, webhookId), eq(workflowLogWebhook.workflowId, workflowId))
      )
      .limit(1)
```
*   **`const [webhook] = await db ...`**: Another database query, this time to fetch the specific webhook configuration.
    *   **`.select()`**: Selects all columns from the table.
    *   **`.from(workflowLogWebhook)`**: Specifies the `workflowLogWebhook` table.
    *   **`.where(and(eq(workflowLogWebhook.id, webhookId), eq(workflowLogWebhook.workflowId, workflowId)))`**: Filters the results to find a webhook where:
        *   Its `id` matches the `webhookId` from the query parameter.
        *   Its `workflowId` matches the `workflowId` from the URL parameter. This double-check ensures the requested webhook truly belongs to the requested workflow.
    *   **`.limit(1)`**: Limits the query to one result, as we expect a unique webhook for the given IDs.
    *   **`const [webhook] = ...`**: Uses array destructuring to get the first (and only) element from the array of results directly into the `webhook` variable. If no webhook is found, `webhook` will be `undefined`.

```typescript
    if (!webhook) {
      return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Webhook not found' }, { status: 404 })
    }
```
*   **`if (!webhook) { ... }`**: Checks if a webhook configuration was found.
*   **`return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Webhook not found' }, { status: 404 })`**: If no matching `webhook` is found in the database, returns a `Not Found` JSON response with status code `404`.

```typescript
    const timestamp = Date.now()
    const eventId = `evt_test_${uuidv4()}`
    const executionId = `exec_test_${uuidv4()}`
    const logId = `log_test_${uuidv4()}`
```
*   **`const timestamp = Date.now()`**: Gets the current time in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. This will be used in the webhook payload and for signature generation.
*   **`const eventId = `evt_test_${uuidv4()}``**: Generates a unique ID for the simulated event, prefixed with `evt_test_` to clearly mark it as a test event.
*   **`const executionId = `exec_test_${uuidv4()}``**: Generates a unique ID for the simulated workflow execution, prefixed with `exec_test_`.
*   **`const logId = `log_test_${uuidv4()}``**: Generates a unique ID for the simulated log entry, prefixed with `log_test_`.

```typescript
    const payload = {
      id: eventId,
      type: 'workflow.execution.completed',
      timestamp,
      data: {
        workflowId,
        executionId,
        status: 'success',
        level: 'info',
        trigger: 'manual',
        startedAt: new Date(timestamp - 5000).toISOString(),
        endedAt: new Date(timestamp).toISOString(),
        totalDurationMs: 5000,
        cost: {
          total: 0.00123,
          tokens: { prompt: 100, completion: 50, total: 150 },
          models: {
            'gpt-4o': {
              input: 0.001,
              output: 0.00023,
              total: 0.00123,
              tokens: { prompt: 100, completion: 50, total: 150 },
            },
          },
        },
        files: null,
      },
      links: {
        log: `/v1/logs/${logId}`,
        execution: `/v1/logs/executions/${executionId}`,
      },
    }
```
*   **`const payload = { ... }`**: Constructs the main JSON object that will be sent as the webhook body. This is a predefined structure for a `workflow.execution.completed` event.
    *   **`id: eventId`**: The unique ID for this specific event.
    *   **`type: 'workflow.execution.completed'`**: The type of event being simulated.
    *   **`timestamp`**: The Unix timestamp when the event occurred.
    *   **`data: { ... }`**: An object containing the primary details of the completed workflow execution.
        *   `workflowId`: The ID of the workflow.
        *   `executionId`: The ID of the specific execution.
        *   `status`, `level`, `trigger`: Standard metadata about the execution.
        *   `startedAt`, `endedAt`: ISO 8601 formatted timestamps for the start and end of the execution (5 seconds difference for testing).
        *   `totalDurationMs`: The duration of the execution in milliseconds.
        *   `cost`: A detailed breakdown of costs, including token usage and per-model costs, useful for AI/LLM-focused workflows.
        *   `files: null`: Placeholder for files, set to null for this test.
    *   **`links: { ... }`**: An object containing URLs related to the event, allowing easy navigation to the log or execution details within the application.

```typescript
    if (webhook.includeFinalOutput) {
      ;(payload.data as any).finalOutput = {
        message: 'This is a test webhook delivery',
        test: true,
      }
    }
```
*   **`if (webhook.includeFinalOutput) { ... }`**: Checks if the `webhook` configuration from the database specifies that the final output of the workflow should be included in the payload.
*   **`(payload.data as any).finalOutput = { ... }`**: If `includeFinalOutput` is `true`, a `finalOutput` property is added to the `data` object of the `payload`.
    *   `(payload.data as any)`: This is a type assertion in TypeScript. It temporarily tells the compiler to treat `payload.data` as `any` type, allowing you to add properties that might not be explicitly defined in its original type definition without a compilation error. This is common when building dynamic objects.
    *   The `finalOutput` object contains test data: a `message` and a `test` flag.

```typescript
    if (webhook.includeTraceSpans) {
      ;(payload.data as any).traceSpans = [
        {
          id: 'span_test_1',
          name: 'Test Block',
          type: 'block',
          status: 'success',
          startTime: new Date(timestamp - 5000).toISOString(),
          endTime: new Date(timestamp).toISOString(),
          duration: 5000,
        },
      ]
    }
```
*   **`if (webhook.includeTraceSpans) { ... }`**: Checks if the webhook configuration specifies including trace spans.
*   **`(payload.data as any).traceSpans = [ ... ]`**: If `includeTraceSpans` is `true`, an array of `traceSpans` is added to `payload.data`. Each span represents a step or block within the workflow execution, with its own ID, name, type, status, and timing information.

```typescript
    if (webhook.includeRateLimits) {
      ;(payload.data as any).rateLimits = {
        sync: {
          limit: 150,
          remaining: 45,
          resetAt: new Date(timestamp + 60000).toISOString(),
        },
        async: {
          limit: 1000,
          remaining: 50,
          resetAt: new Date(timestamp + 60000).toISOString(),
        },
      }
    }
```
*   **`if (webhook.includeRateLimits) { ... }`**: Checks if the webhook configuration specifies including rate limit data.
*   **`(payload.data as any).rateLimits = { ... }`**: If `includeRateLimits` is `true`, a `rateLimits` object is added to `payload.data`, containing test data for synchronous and asynchronous rate limits (total `limit`, `remaining` allowance, and `resetAt` timestamp).

```typescript
    if (webhook.includeUsageData) {
      ;(payload.data as any).usage = {
        currentPeriodCost: 2.45,
        limit: 10,
        plan: 'pro',
        isExceeded: false,
      }
    }
```
*   **`if (webhook.includeUsageData) { ... }`**: Checks if the webhook configuration specifies including usage data.
*   **`(payload.data as any).usage = { ... }`**: If `includeUsageData` is `true`, a `usage` object is added to `payload.data`, providing test data for subscription/usage metrics (cost, limit, plan, and whether the limit is exceeded).

```typescript
    const body = JSON.stringify(payload)
    const deliveryId = `delivery_test_${uuidv4()}`
    const headers: Record<string, string> = {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'sim-event': 'workflow.execution.completed',
      'sim-timestamp': timestamp.toString(),
      'sim-delivery-id': deliveryId,
      'Idempotency-Key': deliveryId,
    }
```
*   **`const body = JSON.stringify(payload)`**: Converts the `payload` object into a JSON string. This string will be the actual body of the HTTP `POST` request sent to the webhook URL.
*   **`const deliveryId = `delivery_test_${uuidv4()}``**: Generates a unique ID for this specific webhook delivery, prefixed with `delivery_test_`. This ID can be used for logging or for an `Idempotency-Key`.
*   **`const headers: Record<string, string> = { ... }`**: Defines an object to store HTTP headers for the outgoing request.
    *   **`'Content-Type': 'application/json'`**: Specifies that the request body is JSON.
    *   **`'sim-event': 'workflow.execution.completed'`**: A custom header (prefixed `sim-` for "Sim" platform) indicating the type of event being delivered.
    *   **`'sim-timestamp': timestamp.toString()`**: A custom header providing the event's timestamp as a string.
    *   **`'sim-delivery-id': deliveryId`**: A custom header providing the unique delivery ID.
    *   **`'Idempotency-Key': deliveryId`**: An HTTP header that helps prevent duplicate processing if the request is retried. If the webhook receiver sees the same `Idempotency-Key` twice, it should ideally process the request only once.

```typescript
    if (webhook.secret) {
      const { decrypted } = await decryptSecret(webhook.secret)
      const signature = generateSignature(decrypted, timestamp, body)
      headers['sim-signature'] = `t=${timestamp},v1=${signature}`
    }
```
*   **`if (webhook.secret) { ... }`**: Checks if the `webhook` configuration includes a `secret`. Webhooks often use secrets to sign payloads, ensuring authenticity and integrity.
    *   **`const { decrypted } = await decryptSecret(webhook.secret)`**: If a secret exists, it's assumed to be encrypted in the database. The `decryptSecret` utility function is called to get the plain text secret.
    *   **`const signature = generateSignature(decrypted, timestamp, body)`**: Calls the `generateSignature` helper function, passing the decrypted secret, the event timestamp, and the JSON `body` to create the HMAC signature.
    *   **`headers['sim-signature'] = `t=${timestamp},v1=${signature}``**: Adds a custom `sim-signature` header to the request. The format (`t=<timestamp>,v1=<signature>`) is a common convention for webhook signatures, allowing the receiver to easily parse the timestamp and signature version.

```typescript
    logger.info(`Sending test webhook to ${webhook.url}`, { workflowId, webhookId })
```
*   **`logger.info(...)`**: Logs an informational message indicating that a test webhook is about to be sent, including the target URL and context (`workflowId`, `webhookId`).

```typescript
    const controller = new AbortController()
    const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 10000)
```
*   **`const controller = new AbortController()`**: Creates a new `AbortController` instance. This object provides a `signal` property that can be passed to `fetch` to enable request cancellation.
*   **`const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 10000)`**: Sets a timeout. After 10,000 milliseconds (10 seconds), the callback function `() => controller.abort()` will be executed.
    *   **`controller.abort()`**: Calling this method will trigger the `AbortSignal` associated with the `controller`, causing any `fetch` requests using that signal to be aborted. This prevents the request from hanging indefinitely if the target server doesn't respond.

```typescript
    try {
      const response = await fetch(webhook.url, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers,
        body,
        signal: controller.signal,
      })

      clearTimeout(timeoutId)
```
*   **`try { ... }`**: An inner `try...catch` block specifically for the `fetch` request, to handle network errors or timeouts.
*   **`const response = await fetch(webhook.url, { ... })`**: Makes the actual HTTP `POST` request to the `webhook.url`.
    *   **`method: 'POST'`**: Specifies the HTTP method.
    *   **`headers`**: The object containing all prepared HTTP headers.
    *   **`body`**: The JSON string payload.
    *   **`signal: controller.signal`**: Links the `fetch` request to the `AbortController`. If `controller.abort()` is called, this `fetch` request will be cancelled.
*   **`clearTimeout(timeoutId)`**: If the `fetch` request completes (either successfully or with an error *other* than an AbortError) before the 10-second timeout, this line clears the timeout, preventing `controller.abort()` from being called unnecessarily.

```typescript
      const responseBody = await response.text().catch(() => '')
      const truncatedBody = responseBody.slice(0, 500)

      const result = {
        success: response.ok,
        status: response.status,
        statusText: response.statusText,
        headers: Object.fromEntries(response.headers.entries()),
        body: truncatedBody,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      }
```
*   **`const responseBody = await response.text().catch(() => '')`**: Attempts to read the response body as text. `.catch(() => '')` handles cases where reading the body might fail (e.g., if the response is empty or invalid), returning an empty string instead of throwing an error.
*   **`const truncatedBody = responseBody.slice(0, 500)`**: Truncates the response body to the first 500 characters. This is useful for logging and storing, preventing very large response bodies from consuming excessive resources.
*   **`const result = { ... }`**: Constructs an object summarizing the outcome of the webhook delivery.
    *   **`success: response.ok`**: A boolean indicating if the HTTP response status code was in the 2xx range (success).
    *   **`status: response.status`**: The HTTP status code (e.g., 200, 404, 500).
    *   **`statusText: response.statusText`**: The status message (e.g., "OK", "Not Found").
    *   **`headers: Object.fromEntries(response.headers.entries())`**: Converts the `Headers` object from the response into a plain JavaScript object for easier viewing/storage.
    *   **`body: truncatedBody`**: The (potentially truncated) body of the response.
    *   **`timestamp: new Date().toISOString()`**: The current time when the result was processed, in ISO 8601 format.

```typescript
      logger.info(`Test webhook completed`, {
        workflowId,
        webhookId,
        status: response.status,
        success: response.ok,
      })

      return NextResponse.json({ data: result })
    } catch (error: any) {
      clearTimeout(timeoutId)
```
*   **`logger.info(...)`**: Logs an informational message about the completion of the test webhook, including the status and success flag.
*   **`return NextResponse.json({ data: result })`**: Returns a `NextResponse` with the `result` object wrapped in a `data` property, indicating the successful handling of the API request and the outcome of the webhook test.
*   **`catch (error: any) { ... }`**: Catches any errors that occur during the `fetch` request (e.g., network issues, DNS resolution failures, or the `AbortError` from the timeout).
*   **`clearTimeout(timeoutId)`**: Ensures the timeout is always cleared, even if an error occurs within the `fetch` `try` block.

```typescript
      if (error.name === 'AbortError') {
        logger.error(`Test webhook timed out`, { workflowId, webhookId })
        return NextResponse.json({
          data: {
            success: false,
            error: 'Request timeout after 10 seconds',
            timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
          },
        })
      }
```
*   **`if (error.name === 'AbortError') { ... }`**: Specifically checks if the error was due to the `AbortController` cancelling the request (i.e., the 10-second timeout was reached).
    *   **`logger.error(...)`**: Logs an error message indicating a timeout.
    *   **`return NextResponse.json({ data: { ... } })`**: Returns a JSON response with `success: false` and a specific error message for a timeout.

```typescript
      logger.error(`Test webhook failed`, {
        workflowId,
        webhookId,
        error: error.message,
      })

      return NextResponse.json({
        data: {
          success: false,
          error: error.message,
          timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
        },
      })
    }
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Error testing webhook', { error })
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Internal server error' }, { status: 500 })
  }
}
```
*   **`logger.error(...)`**: If the error is not an `AbortError`, logs a generic "Test webhook failed" message with the error details.
*   **`return NextResponse.json({ data: { ... } })`**: Returns a JSON response indicating failure with the generic error message and `success: false`.
*   **`} catch (error) { ... }`**: This is the outer `catch` block, handling any unexpected errors that might occur *outside* the `fetch` operation (e.g., database query failures, decryption errors, or issues with session retrieval).
    *   **`logger.error('Error testing webhook', { error })`**: Logs the unexpected error.
    *   **`return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Internal server error' }, { status: 500 })`**: Returns a `500 Internal Server Error` response, indicating a problem on the server side that prevented the request from being processed. This provides a general error message to the client without exposing sensitive internal details.
