This TypeScript file defines an API endpoint in a Next.js application. Its primary function is to **revert a specific workflow to a previously deployed version**, either the currently active one or a historical version. It handles authentication, data retrieval from a database, updating the workflow's state, and notifying a real-time system about the change.

---

### Purpose of This File and What It Does

This file defines a Next.js API route (`/api/workflows/[id]/revert/[version]`) that allows users to restore a workflow to a specific deployed state. When a workflow is reverted, its current design (blocks, edges, etc.) is replaced with the design from the chosen deployment version.

Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1.  **Receives a POST request**: It listens for requests to revert a workflow, identified by its `id`, to a specific `version` (either "active" or a numerical version number).
2.  **Validates Permissions**: It first checks if the user making the request has `admin` permissions for the specified workflow.
3.  **Determines Target Version**: It figures out whether the request is to revert to the currently "active" deployment or a specific numbered version.
4.  **Retrieves Deployed State**: It queries the database (`workflowDeploymentVersion` table) to fetch the saved `state` (which includes workflow blocks, edges, etc.) of the chosen deployment version.
5.  **Validates Retrieved State**: It ensures that the retrieved state contains the necessary components (blocks and edges).
6.  **Updates Workflow**: It then uses the retrieved deployed state to update the main workflow definition in the database (`workflow` table and related normalized tables). This effectively "reverts" the workflow's design.
7.  **Updates Metadata**: It updates `lastSynced` and `updatedAt` timestamps for the main workflow record.
8.  **Notifies Socket Server**: It attempts to send a real-time notification to a separate socket server, informing it that the workflow has been reverted. This is likely for real-time UI updates or other downstream processes.
9.  **Responds to Client**: It returns a success message or an error message if any step fails.

In essence, this API allows administrators or authorized users to undo recent changes to a workflow by rolling back its design to a stable, previously deployed configuration.

---

### Simplified Complex Logic

The core logic of this API can be broken down into these straightforward steps:

1.  **Setup and Authorization**:
    *   Generate a unique request ID for logging.
    *   Extract the `workflowId` and `version` from the request URL.
    *   Verify that the user has `admin` rights for this `workflowId`. If not, stop and return an error.

2.  **Identify and Fetch Deployment State**:
    *   Determine if the user wants the "active" deployment or a specific numbered version.
    *   Query the database to find the *exact* saved state (blocks, edges, etc.) associated with that deployment version for the given `workflowId`.
    *   If no such state is found or if the state is malformed, stop and return an error.

3.  **Apply Retrieved State to Workflow**:
    *   Take the validated blocks, edges, and other configuration from the fetched deployment state.
    *   Update the main workflow record and its associated data tables in the database with this retrieved information. Mark the workflow as deployed.
    *   If updating fails, stop and return an error.

4.  **Finalize and Notify**:
    *   Update the workflow's `lastSynced` and `updatedAt` timestamps in the main workflow table.
    *   Attempt to send a POST request to a separate socket server to notify it about the workflow reversion. (This notification is a best-effort attempt; if it fails, the API still succeeds if the database updates were successful).
    *   Send a success response back to the client. If any unexpected error occurred during the process, catch it and send a generic error response.

### Deep Line-by-Line Explanation

```typescript
import { db, workflow, workflowDeploymentVersion } from '@sim/db'
```

*   **`import { db, workflow, workflowDeploymentVersion } from '@sim/db'`**: This line imports necessary modules from a local package `@sim/db`.
    *   `db`: This is likely an instance of a database client (e.g., Drizzle, Prisma, Kysely) configured to interact with the database. It's used for executing database queries.
    *   `workflow`: This refers to the Drizzle ORM schema/table definition for the main `workflow` table in the database.
    *   `workflowDeploymentVersion`: This refers to the Drizzle ORM schema/table definition for the `workflowDeploymentVersion` table, which stores different deployed states of a workflow.

```typescript
import { and, eq } from 'drizzle-orm'
```

*   **`import { and, eq } from 'drizzle-orm'`**: Imports utility functions from the `drizzle-orm` library.
    *   `and`: Used to combine multiple conditions in a `WHERE` clause with a logical AND operator.
    *   `eq`: Used to create an equality condition (e.g., `column = value`).

```typescript
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'
```

*   **`import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'`**: Imports the `NextRequest` type from Next.js, used for type-hinting the `request` object in API routes. `type` ensures it's only imported for type checking and doesn't affect the compiled JavaScript bundle.

```typescript
import { env } from '@/lib/env'
```

*   **`import { env } from '@/lib/env'`**: Imports an `env` object, likely a utility that provides access to environment variables (e.g., `process.env`) with proper validation and typing.

```typescript
import { createLogger } from '@/lib/logs/console/logger'
```

*   **`import { createLogger } from '@/lib/logs/console/logger'`**: Imports a function `createLogger` from a custom logging utility. This function is used to create a logger instance for this specific module, allowing for better structured and contextualized logging.

```typescript
import { generateRequestId } from '@/lib/utils'
```

*   **`import { generateRequestId } from '@/lib/utils'`**: Imports a utility function to generate a unique request ID. This ID is useful for tracing individual requests through logs.

```typescript
import { saveWorkflowToNormalizedTables } from '@/lib/workflows/db-helpers'
```

*   **`import { saveWorkflowToNormalizedTables } from '@/lib/workflows/db-helpers'`**: Imports a helper function responsible for saving workflow data (blocks, edges, loops, parallels) to various "normalized" database tables. This suggests that the workflow's structure might be broken down into multiple related tables for better database design and querying.

```typescript
import { validateWorkflowPermissions } from '@/lib/workflows/utils'
```

*   **`import { validateWorkflowPermissions } from '@/lib/workflows/utils'`**: Imports a utility function to check if the current user has the necessary permissions (e.g., `admin`) for a given workflow.

```typescript
import { createErrorResponse, createSuccessResponse } from '@/app/api/workflows/utils'
```

*   **`import { createErrorResponse, createSuccessResponse } from '@/app/api/workflows/utils'`**: Imports helper functions for creating standardized JSON responses for API calls.
    *   `createErrorResponse`: Creates an API response indicating an error, usually with a message and an HTTP status code.
    *   `createSuccessResponse`: Creates an API response indicating success, often with a message and data.

```typescript
const logger = createLogger('RevertToDeploymentVersionAPI')
```

*   **`const logger = createLogger('RevertToDeploymentVersionAPI')`**: Initializes a logger instance specifically for this API route, identifying it as `RevertToDeploymentVersionAPI` in the logs.

```typescript
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'
```

*   **`export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`**: This is a Next.js specific export. It tells Next.js to treat this API route as a dynamic route, meaning it should not be cached and should be rendered on demand for every request. This is crucial for API endpoints that perform database writes or deal with frequently changing data.

```typescript
export const runtime = 'nodejs'
```

*   **`export const runtime = 'nodejs'`**: Another Next.js specific export. It specifies that this API route should run in the Node.js runtime environment. This is often the default, but explicitly setting it can be important in environments where other runtimes (like Edge) are available, especially when using Node.js-specific APIs (like Drizzle ORM or `process.env`).

```typescript
export async function POST(
  request: NextRequest,
  { params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string; version: string }> }
) {
```

*   **`export async function POST(...)`**: Defines the main asynchronous function that handles `POST` requests to this API route. Next.js automatically calls this function for `POST` requests matching the route.
    *   `request: NextRequest`: The first parameter is the incoming HTTP request object, typed as `NextRequest`, providing access to headers, body, URL, etc.
    *   `{ params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string; version: string }> }`: The second parameter is an object containing route parameters.
        *   `params`: This object will contain properties corresponding to the dynamic parts of the route (`[id]` and `[version]`).
        *   `Promise<{ id: string; version: string }>`: `params` is typed as a Promise because in Next.js App Router, dynamic parameters might be available asynchronously. `id` is the workflow ID, and `version` is the deployment version (e.g., "active", "1", "2").

```typescript
  const requestId = generateRequestId()
```

*   **`const requestId = generateRequestId()`**: Generates a unique identifier for the current request. This ID is logged and can be used to track the lifecycle of this specific API call.

```typescript
  const { id, version } = await params
```

*   **`const { id, version } = await params`**: Destructures the `params` object (waiting for the Promise to resolve) to extract the `id` (workflow ID) and `version` (deployment version string) from the URL parameters.

```typescript
  try {
```

*   **`try {`**: Starts a `try` block. Any code within this block that throws an error will be caught by the subsequent `catch` block, allowing for graceful error handling.

```typescript
    const { error } = await validateWorkflowPermissions(id, requestId, 'admin')
    if (error) {
      return createErrorResponse(error.message, error.status)
    }
```

*   **`const { error } = await validateWorkflowPermissions(id, requestId, 'admin')`**: Calls the permission validation utility. It checks if the current user has `admin` permissions for the workflow specified by `id`. It also passes the `requestId` for logging context.
*   **`if (error) { ... }`**: If `validateWorkflowPermissions` returns an `error` object (meaning permission was denied or an issue occurred), the function immediately returns an error response using `createErrorResponse` with the error message and status.

```typescript
    const versionSelector = version === 'active' ? null : Number(version)
```

*   **`const versionSelector = version === 'active' ? null : Number(version)`**: This line determines how to select the deployment version.
    *   If `version` is the string `'active'`, `versionSelector` is set to `null`. This `null` will be a flag for later logic to fetch the actively deployed version.
    *   Otherwise, it attempts to convert the `version` string to a number (e.g., "1" becomes `1`).

```typescript
    if (version !== 'active' && !Number.isFinite(versionSelector)) {
      return createErrorResponse('Invalid version', 400)
    }
```

*   **`if (version !== 'active' && !Number.isFinite(versionSelector)) { ... }`**: This is an input validation step.
    *   It checks if the `version` is *not* `'active'` AND if `versionSelector` (which was the result of `Number(version)`) is *not* a finite number.
    *   `Number.isFinite()` checks if a value is a finite number, excluding `NaN`, `Infinity`, `-Infinity`. If `Number(version)` failed to parse a number (e.g., `Number('abc')` results in `NaN`), `Number.isFinite()` would return `false`.
    *   If both conditions are true, it means an invalid version string (not 'active' and not a valid number) was provided, so it returns a `400 Bad Request` error.

```typescript
    let stateRow: { state: any } | null = null
```

*   **`let stateRow: { state: any } | null = null`**: Declares a variable `stateRow` that will hold the result of the database query for the deployed workflow state. It's typed to be an object with a `state` property (which can be any type, as the `state` column likely stores JSON) or `null` if no row is found.

```typescript
    if (version === 'active') {
      const [row] = await db
        .select({ state: workflowDeploymentVersion.state })
        .from(workflowDeploymentVersion)
        .where(
          and(
            eq(workflowDeploymentVersion.workflowId, id),
            eq(workflowDeploymentVersion.isActive, true)
          )
        )
        .limit(1)
      stateRow = row || null
    } else {
      const [row] = await db
        .select({ state: workflowDeploymentVersion.state })
        .from(workflowDeploymentVersion)
        .where(
          and(
            eq(workflowDeploymentVersion.workflowId, id),
            eq(workflowDeploymentVersion.version, versionSelector as number)
          )
        )
        .limit(1)
      stateRow = row || null
    }
```

*   This block conditionally queries the `workflowDeploymentVersion` table based on whether the `version` is `'active'` or a specific number.
    *   **`if (version === 'active') { ... }`**:
        *   `const [row] = await db.select({ state: workflowDeploymentVersion.state })`: Executes a database query to select only the `state` column from the `workflowDeploymentVersion` table. `[row]` destructures the array result to get the first (and only) row.
        *   `.from(workflowDeploymentVersion)`: Specifies the table to query.
        *   `.where(and(eq(workflowDeploymentVersion.workflowId, id), eq(workflowDeploymentVersion.isActive, true)))`: Filters the results. It uses `and` to combine two conditions:
            *   `eq(workflowDeploymentVersion.workflowId, id)`: The `workflowId` must match the `id` from the URL.
            *   `eq(workflowDeploymentVersion.isActive, true)`: The `isActive` flag for the deployment must be `true`.
        *   `.limit(1)`: Ensures only one record is returned, as there should only be one active deployment per workflow.
        *   `stateRow = row || null`: Assigns the found row (or `null` if no row was found) to `stateRow`.
    *   **`else { ... }`**: This block executes if `version` is a numerical value.
        *   The structure is very similar to the `if` block.
        *   `.where(and(eq(workflowDeploymentVersion.workflowId, id), eq(workflowDeploymentVersion.version, versionSelector as number)))`: The `WHERE` clause is slightly different. Instead of `isActive`, it filters by the specific `version` number, cast to `number` using `as number`.
        *   `stateRow = row || null`: Assigns the found row to `stateRow`.

```typescript
    if (!stateRow?.state) {
      return createErrorResponse('Deployment version not found', 404)
    }
```

*   **`if (!stateRow?.state) { ... }`**: After the database query, this checks if `stateRow` is `null` (no deployment found) or if `stateRow.state` is `null`/`undefined` (meaning the row was found but the state itself was missing). If so, it returns a `404 Not Found` error. The optional chaining `?.` safely accesses `state` only if `stateRow` is not `null`.

```typescript
    const deployedState = stateRow.state
    if (!deployedState.blocks || !deployedState.edges) {
      return createErrorResponse('Invalid deployed state structure', 500)
    }
```

*   **`const deployedState = stateRow.state`**: Extracts the `state` object from the `stateRow`.
*   **`if (!deployedState.blocks || !deployedState.edges) { ... }`**: Performs a basic validation on the `deployedState`. It ensures that the state contains at least `blocks` and `edges` properties, which are fundamental components of a workflow design. If these are missing, it indicates a malformed state and returns a `500 Internal Server Error`.

```typescript
    const saveResult = await saveWorkflowToNormalizedTables(id, {
      blocks: deployedState.blocks,
      edges: deployedState.edges,
      loops: deployedState.loops || {},
      parallels: deployedState.parallels || {},
      lastSaved: Date.now(),
      isDeployed: true,
      deployedAt: new Date(),
      deploymentStatuses: deployedState.deploymentStatuses || {},
    })
```

*   **`const saveResult = await saveWorkflowToNormalizedTables(id, { ... })`**: This is a critical step where the retrieved deployed state is applied to the workflow.
    *   It calls the `saveWorkflowToNormalizedTables` helper function, passing the `workflowId` (`id`) and an object containing the workflow's new state.
    *   The object includes:
        *   `blocks`, `edges`: Taken directly from `deployedState`.
        *   `loops`, `parallels`: Also from `deployedState`, with a fallback to an empty object `{}` if they are `undefined` or `null` in the deployed state.
        *   `lastSaved: Date.now()`: Updates the `lastSaved` timestamp to the current time.
        *   `isDeployed: true`: Marks the workflow as being currently deployed.
        *   `deployedAt: new Date()`: Sets the deployment timestamp to now.
        *   `deploymentStatuses`: From `deployedState`, with a fallback to an empty object `{}`.
    *   This function likely updates multiple tables (hence "normalized") to reflect the new workflow design.

```typescript
    if (!saveResult.success) {
      return createErrorResponse(saveResult.error || 'Failed to save deployed state', 500)
    }
```

*   **`if (!saveResult.success) { ... }`**: Checks the `saveResult` from `saveWorkflowToNormalizedTables`. If `success` is `false`, it means the save operation failed. It then returns a `500 Internal Server Error` with the error message from `saveResult.error` or a generic fallback message.

```typescript
    await db
      .update(workflow)
      .set({ lastSynced: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date() })
      .where(eq(workflow.id, id))
```

*   **`await db.update(workflow).set({ lastSynced: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date() }).where(eq(workflow.id, id))`**: After successfully saving the deployed state to the normalized tables, this line updates the main `workflow` table itself.
    *   `db.update(workflow)`: Initiates an update operation on the `workflow` table.
    *   `.set({ lastSynced: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date() })`: Sets the `lastSynced` and `updatedAt` timestamps for the workflow to the current date and time. This marks the workflow record as recently modified/synchronized.
    *   `.where(eq(workflow.id, id))`: Ensures that only the workflow matching the provided `id` is updated.

```typescript
    try {
      const socketServerUrl = env.SOCKET_SERVER_URL || 'http://localhost:3002'
      await fetch(`${socketServerUrl}/api/workflow-reverted`, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({ workflowId: id, timestamp: Date.now() }),
      })
    } catch (e) {
      logger.error('Error sending workflow reverted event to socket server', e)
    }
```

*   **`try { ... } catch (e) { ... }`**: This block attempts to notify a separate socket server about the workflow reversion. It's wrapped in a `try...catch` because the notification is important but not critical enough to halt the entire API request if it fails.
    *   `const socketServerUrl = env.SOCKET_SERVER_URL || 'http://localhost:3002'`: Retrieves the URL for the socket server from environment variables. If it's not set, it defaults to `http://localhost:3002`.
    *   `await fetch(`${socketServerUrl}/api/workflow-reverted`, { ... })`: Makes an HTTP `POST` request to the socket server's `/api/workflow-reverted` endpoint.
        *   `method: 'POST'`: Specifies the request method.
        *   `headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }`: Sets the content type for the request body.
        *   `body: JSON.stringify({ workflowId: id, timestamp: Date.now() })`: Sends a JSON payload containing the `workflowId` and the current `timestamp`. This allows the socket server to potentially emit a real-time event to connected clients.
    *   `catch (e) { logger.error('Error sending workflow reverted event to socket server', e) }`: If the `fetch` call fails (e.g., network error, server not reachable), it catches the error and logs it using the `logger`, but does not re-throw it or return an error response, meaning the main API call will still succeed from the client's perspective.

```typescript
    return createSuccessResponse({
      message: 'Reverted to deployment version',
      lastSaved: Date.now(),
    })
  } catch (error: any) {
    logger.error('Error reverting to deployment version', error)
    return createErrorResponse(error.message || 'Failed to revert', 500)
  }
}
```

*   **`return createSuccessResponse({ message: 'Reverted to deployment version', lastSaved: Date.now(), })`**: If all steps in the `try` block complete successfully, this line returns a `200 OK` success response using `createSuccessResponse`, indicating that the workflow has been reverted. It includes a message and the `lastSaved` timestamp.
*   **`}`**: Closes the `try` block.
*   **`catch (error: any) { ... }`**: This `catch` block handles any *unexpected* errors that occurred within the main `try` block (i.e., errors not explicitly handled by earlier `if (error)` checks or nested `try...catch` blocks).
    *   `logger.error('Error reverting to deployment version', error)`: Logs the error using the `logger`, providing context and the error object itself for debugging.
    *   `return createErrorResponse(error.message || 'Failed to revert', 500)`: Returns a `500 Internal Server Error` response to the client. It uses the error's message if available, otherwise a generic "Failed to revert" message.
*   **`}`**: Closes the `POST` function.
