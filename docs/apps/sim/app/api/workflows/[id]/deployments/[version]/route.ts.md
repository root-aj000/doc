This TypeScript file defines an API endpoint for a Next.js application, specifically designed to manage individual versions of workflow deployments. It offers two main functionalities:
1.  **Retrieving (`GET`)**: Fetching the deployed state of a particular workflow version.
2.  **Updating (`PATCH`)**: Renaming a specific workflow deployment version.

In essence, this file acts as a server-side handler for requests related to `/api/workflows/[workflowId]/[version]`, providing secure, validated, and logged operations for viewing and modifying deployment version metadata.

---

### File Overview and Imports

This file is a Next.js API route, meaning it defines functions that respond to HTTP requests. Next.js automatically routes incoming requests to these functions based on the file's location and the function's name (`GET`, `PATCH`, etc.).

Let's break down the essential imports:

*   `import { db, workflowDeploymentVersion } from '@sim/db'`:
    *   `db`: This is the instance of your Drizzle ORM database client. It's the primary tool used to perform queries (select, insert, update, delete) against your database.
    *   `workflowDeploymentVersion`: This represents the schema of the `workflow_deployment_version` table in your database. It's a Drizzle ORM object that defines the table's structure and its columns, allowing you to interact with it in a type-safe way.
*   `import { and, eq } from 'drizzle-orm'`:
    *   These are helper functions from the Drizzle ORM library used to build complex query conditions:
        *   `and`: Combines multiple conditions with a logical "AND". For a row to be selected, *all* conditions joined by `and` must be true.
        *   `eq`: Stands for "equals." It creates a condition that checks if a column's value is equal to a specified value.
*   `import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'`:
    *   This imports the `NextRequest` type, which is Next.js's standard object representing an incoming HTTP request. It provides access to request details like URL, headers, and body.
*   `import { createLogger } from '@/lib/logs/console/logger'`:
    *   Imports a function to create a logger. This allows for structured logging, making it easier to monitor and debug the API's behavior.
*   `import { generateRequestId } from '@/lib/utils'`:
    *   Imports a utility function that generates a unique identifier for each incoming request. This `requestId` is crucial for tracing individual requests through logs, especially in distributed systems.
*   `import { validateWorkflowPermissions } from '@/lib/workflows/utils'`:
    *   Imports a security utility function. Before any operation (read or write) on a workflow, this function checks if the user making the request has the necessary permissions.
*   `import { createErrorResponse, createSuccessResponse } from '@/app/api/workflows/utils'`:
    *   These are helper functions for creating consistent API responses:
        *   `createErrorResponse`: Formats an error message and HTTP status code into a standardized error response object.
        *   `createSuccessResponse`: Formats successful data into a standardized success response object.

---

### Configuration and Logger

*   `const logger = createLogger('WorkflowDeploymentVersionAPI')`:
    *   An instance of the logger is created, specifically named `WorkflowDeploymentVersionAPI`. This ensures that all log messages originating from this file will be identifiable, aiding in debugging and monitoring.
*   `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`:
    *   This is a Next.js specific configuration. It tells Next.js that this API route should *always* be dynamically rendered on the server for every request, rather than being statically optimized or cached. This is suitable for APIs that handle real-time data or require fresh responses every time.
*   `export const runtime = 'nodejs'`:
    *   Another Next.js configuration, specifying that this API route should execute in a Node.js environment. This is the default and allows access to Node.js APIs and npm packages.

---

### `GET` Function: Retrieve Workflow Deployment Version State

This function handles HTTP `GET` requests. Its purpose is to fetch the `state` of a specific workflow deployment version, identified by its workflow ID and version number.

```typescript
export async function GET(
  request: NextRequest,
  { params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string; version: string }> }
) {
```

*   **`export async function GET(...)`**: Declares an asynchronous function named `GET`. Next.js automatically calls this function for `GET` requests directed at this API route. The `async` keyword indicates that the function will perform operations that take time (like database queries) without blocking the main thread.
*   **`request: NextRequest`**: This parameter receives an object (`NextRequest`) containing all the details of the incoming HTTP request.
*   **`{ params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string; version: string }> }`**: This parameter uses object destructuring. In Next.js, `params` will contain dynamic segments from the URL. For example, if the route is `/api/workflows/[id]/[version]` and the URL is `/api/workflows/my-workflow-123/v2`, then `id` would be `'my-workflow-123'` and `version` would be `'v2'`. Since `params` is a `Promise`, its values need to be `await`ed before use.

Now, let's go line-by-line through its body:

```typescript
  const requestId = generateRequestId()
```

*   `const requestId = generateRequestId()`: A unique identifier is generated for this specific incoming request. This ID will be used in logs to track the request's journey.

```typescript
  const { id, version } = await params
```

*   `const { id, version } = await params`: The dynamic parts of the URL (`id` for workflow ID and `version` for deployment version number) are extracted from the `params` object, awaiting its resolution.

```typescript
  try {
```

*   `try { ... } catch (error: any) { ... }`: This initiates a `try...catch` block, a fundamental pattern for error handling in asynchronous JavaScript/TypeScript. Any error that occurs within the `try` block will be caught and handled by the `catch` block.

```typescript
    const { error } = await validateWorkflowPermissions(id, requestId, 'read')
    if (error) {
      return createErrorResponse(error.message, error.status)
    }
```

*   `const { error } = await validateWorkflowPermissions(id, requestId, 'read')`: Before accessing any data, a security check is performed. This calls a utility function to verify if the user/caller has "read" permissions for the `workflowId` (`id`). The `requestId` is passed for internal logging within the permission check.
*   `if (error) { return createErrorResponse(error.message, error.status) }`: If the `validateWorkflowPermissions` function returns an `error` object (indicating a permission denied or other authorization issue), an appropriate error response is immediately created and returned to the client with the specified message and HTTP status code (e.g., 403 Forbidden).

```typescript
    const versionNum = Number(version)
    if (!Number.isFinite(versionNum)) {
      return createErrorResponse('Invalid version', 400)
    }
```

*   `const versionNum = Number(version)`: The `version` from the URL, which is a string, is converted into a number.
*   `if (!Number.isFinite(versionNum)) { return createErrorResponse('Invalid version', 400) }`: This line validates the conversion. `Number.isFinite()` checks if the result is a valid, finite number (not `NaN`, `Infinity`, or `-Infinity`). If the `version` string couldn't be converted into a proper number, a "Bad Request" (400) error is returned.

```typescript
    const [row] = await db
      .select({ state: workflowDeploymentVersion.state })
      .from(workflowDeploymentVersion)
      .where(
        and(
          eq(workflowDeploymentVersion.workflowId, id),
          eq(workflowDeploymentVersion.version, versionNum)
        )
      )
      .limit(1)
```

*   `const [row] = await db.select(...)`: This is the core database query using Drizzle ORM:
    *   `db.select({ state: workflowDeploymentVersion.state })`: Specifies that only the `state` column should be retrieved from the database. The `{ state: ... }` syntax aliases the returned column to `state`.
    *   `.from(workflowDeploymentVersion)`: Indicates that the query is targeting the `workflow_deployment_version` table.
    *   `.where(...)`: Applies a filter to find the correct row:
        *   `and(...)`: Combines the following two conditions with a logical AND.
        *   `eq(workflowDeploymentVersion.workflowId, id)`: Finds rows where the `workflowId` column matches the `id` from the URL.
        *   `eq(workflowDeploymentVersion.version, versionNum)`: Finds rows where the `version` column matches the validated `versionNum`.
    *   `.limit(1)`: Instructs the database to return at most one matching row, as the combination of `workflowId` and `version` is expected to be unique.
    *   `const [row] = ...`: Drizzle queries return an array of results. Using array destructuring `[row]`, the first (and only expected) result is assigned to the `row` variable. If no matching record is found, `row` will be `undefined`.

```typescript
    if (!row?.state) {
      return createErrorResponse('Deployment version not found', 404)
    }
```

*   `if (!row?.state)`: This checks two things: if a `row` was found at all (`row` is not `undefined`), and if that `row` has a `state` property that is not null or undefined. The `?.` (optional chaining) safely accesses `state`. If no matching deployment version is found in the database, a "Not Found" (404) error response is returned.

```typescript
    return createSuccessResponse({ deployedState: row.state })
```

*   `return createSuccessResponse({ deployedState: row.state })`: If a matching deployment version is found, a success response is created, returning the `state` value from the database under the `deployedState` key.

```typescript
  } catch (error: any) {
    logger.error(
      `[${requestId}] Error fetching deployment version ${version} for workflow ${id}`,
      error
    )
    return createErrorResponse(error.message || 'Failed to fetch deployment version', 500)
  }
```

*   `catch (error: any)`: If any unexpected error occurs during the execution of the `try` block, this block is executed.
*   `logger.error(...)`: An error message is logged using the `logger`, including the `requestId` and details about the failed operation and the `error` object itself.
*   `return createErrorResponse(error.message || 'Failed to fetch deployment version', 500)`: A generic "Internal Server Error" (500) response is returned to the client. It attempts to use the actual error message if available, otherwise, it falls back to a default message.

### `PATCH` Function: Rename Workflow Deployment Version

This function handles HTTP `PATCH` requests. Its purpose is to update (rename) a specific workflow deployment version.

```typescript
export async function PATCH(
  request: NextRequest,
  { params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string; version: string }> }
) {
```

*   **`export async function PATCH(...)`**: Declares an asynchronous function named `PATCH`. Next.js calls this for `PATCH` requests. `PATCH` is typically used for partial updates to an existing resource.
*   **Parameters**: The `request` and `params` parameters are identical in their structure and purpose to those in the `GET` function.

Let's examine the `PATCH` function's body line-by-line:

```typescript
  const requestId = generateRequestId()
  const { id, version } = await params
```

*   These lines are identical to the `GET` function: a `requestId` is generated, and `id` and `version` are extracted from the URL parameters.

```typescript
  try {
```

*   `try { ... } catch (error: any) { ... }`: The main logic is again wrapped in a `try...catch` block for robust error handling.

```typescript
    const { error } = await validateWorkflowPermissions(id, requestId, 'write')
    if (error) {
      return createErrorResponse(error.message, error.status)
    }
```

*   `const { error } = await validateWorkflowPermissions(id, requestId, 'write')`: This is another permission check, but this time it verifies if the user has "write" permissions for the specified `workflowId` (`id`), as this operation modifies data. If not, an error response is returned.

```typescript
    const versionNum = Number(version)
    if (!Number.isFinite(versionNum)) {
      return createErrorResponse('Invalid version', 400)
    }
```

*   These lines are identical to the `GET` function, ensuring the `version` parameter from the URL is a valid, finite number.

```typescript
    const body = await request.json()
    const { name } = body
```

*   `const body = await request.json()`: For `PATCH` requests, the client typically sends data in the request body. This line parses the incoming request body, assuming it's JSON, and stores it in the `body` variable.
*   `const { name } = body`: It then destructures the `body` object to extract the `name` property, which is expected to be the new name for the deployment version.

```typescript
    if (typeof name !== 'string') {
      return createErrorResponse('Name must be a string', 400)
    }

    const trimmedName = name.trim()
    if (trimmedName.length === 0) {
      return createErrorResponse('Name cannot be empty', 400)
    }

    if (trimmedName.length > 100) {
      return createErrorResponse('Name must be 100 characters or less', 400)
    }
```

*   These lines perform extensive validation on the `name` received from the request body:
    *   `if (typeof name !== 'string')`: Checks if the `name` is indeed a string. If not, it's a "Bad Request" (400).
    *   `const trimmedName = name.trim()`: Removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the `name`.
    *   `if (trimmedName.length === 0)`: Checks if the `name` is empty after trimming. Empty names are usually invalid, so a 400 error is returned.
    *   `if (trimmedName.length > 100)`: Enforces a maximum length of 100 characters for the `name`, preventing excessively long names that might cause database issues or display problems. If exceeded, a 400 error is returned.

```typescript
    const [updated] = await db
      .update(workflowDeploymentVersion)
      .set({ name: trimmedName })
      .where(
        and(
          eq(workflowDeploymentVersion.workflowId, id),
          eq(workflowDeploymentVersion.version, versionNum)
        )
      )
      .returning({ id: workflowDeploymentVersion.id, name: workflowDeploymentVersion.name })
```

*   `const [updated] = await db.update(...)`: This is the Drizzle ORM query to update the database record:
    *   `db.update(workflowDeploymentVersion)`: Specifies that an update operation will be performed on the `workflow_deployment_version` table.
    *   `.set({ name: trimmedName })`: Defines the changes to be applied. Here, the `name` column of the matching row(s) will be set to the `trimmedName`.
    *   `.where(...)`: Critically important, this clause specifies *which* rows to update. It uses the same `and` and `eq` conditions as the `GET` request to uniquely identify the target workflow deployment version using `workflowId` and `version`.
    *   `.returning({ id: workflowDeploymentVersion.id, name: workflowDeploymentVersion.name })`: This Drizzle-specific clause tells the database to return the `id` and the *new* `name` of the row(s) that were successfully updated. This confirms the update and provides the updated data.
    *   `const [updated] = ...`: Again, array destructuring is used to extract the single (expected) updated record into the `updated` variable. If no record matched the `where` clause, `updated` will be `undefined`.

```typescript
    if (!updated) {
      return createErrorResponse('Deployment version not found', 404)
    }
```

*   `if (!updated)`: If `updated` is `undefined`, it means no record matching the provided `workflowId` and `version` was found in the database, and thus nothing could be updated. A "Not Found" (404) error is returned.

```typescript
    logger.info(
      `[${requestId}] Renamed deployment version ${version} for workflow ${id} to "${trimmedName}"`
    )
```

*   `logger.info(...)`: If the update was successful, an informational log entry is created, detailing the successful rename operation, including the `requestId` for tracing.

```typescript
    return createSuccessResponse({ name: updated.name })
```

*   `return createSuccessResponse({ name: updated.name })`: A success response is returned to the client, including the newly updated `name` of the deployment version.

```typescript
  } catch (error: any) {
    logger.error(
      `[${requestId}] Error renaming deployment version ${version} for workflow ${id}`,
      error
    )
    return createErrorResponse(error.message || 'Failed to rename deployment version', 500)
  }
}
```

*   `catch (error: any)`: Catches any unexpected errors that occur during the `PATCH` operation.
*   `logger.error(...)`: Logs the error with context (`requestId`, `id`, `version`) and the `error` object.
*   `return createErrorResponse(error.message || 'Failed to rename deployment version', 500)`: Returns a generic "Internal Server Error" (500) response to the client, using the error's message if available.
