This TypeScript file defines an API endpoint for a Next.js application. Its primary purpose is to retrieve detailed information about a specific workflow execution, including its basic metadata and the detailed state of the workflow at the time of execution.

Imagine you have a system that runs various automated "workflows" (like a series of steps to process an order). Each time a workflow runs, it creates an "execution log" to track what happened, and it might also save a "snapshot" of its internal state (all its data) at a certain point. This file provides a way to look up a specific workflow run by its unique ID and get all that information back.

---

### **Detailed Explanation**

Let's break down the code piece by piece:

```typescript
import { db } from '@sim/db'
import { workflowExecutionLogs, workflowExecutionSnapshots } from '@sim/db/schema'
import { eq } from 'drizzle-orm'
import { type NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { createLogger } from '@/lib/logs/console/logger'
```

*   **`import { db } from '@sim/db'`**:
    *   This line imports the database client from a local module identified by the alias `@sim/db`. This `db` object is what allows the application to connect to and interact with the database (e.g., run queries).
*   **`import { workflowExecutionLogs, workflowExecutionSnapshots } from '@sim/db/schema'`**:
    *   This imports specific table definitions (or "schemas") from your database schema module.
    *   `workflowExecutionLogs`: Represents the table that stores records of each time a workflow was run, containing high-level information like start/end times, triggers, and a reference to its state snapshot.
    *   `workflowExecutionSnapshots`: Represents the table that stores detailed "snapshots" of the workflow's internal state data at a particular moment during its execution.
*   **`import { eq } from 'drizzle-orm'`**:
    *   This imports the `eq` (equals) function from `drizzle-orm`. Drizzle ORM is a TypeScript ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) that allows you to write database queries using TypeScript syntax rather than raw SQL strings, making them type-safe and easier to manage. The `eq` function is used to create "equality" conditions in `WHERE` clauses (e.g., `WHERE column = value`).
*   **`import { type NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'`**:
    *   These are Next.js-specific imports for handling API routes.
    *   `NextRequest`: Represents the incoming HTTP request object, containing details like headers, body, query parameters, etc. (We use `type` here because we're only importing the type definition, not the actual class, which is a good practice for performance and clarity when only type information is needed).
    *   `NextResponse`: Used to construct and send the HTTP response back to the client, allowing you to set status codes, headers, and the response body (e.g., JSON).
*   **`import { createLogger } from '@/lib/logs/console/logger'`**:
    *   This imports a function `createLogger` from a local logging utility. This function is likely used to set up a logger instance that can output messages (debug, info, error) to the console or other logging destinations.

---

```typescript
const logger = createLogger('LogsByExecutionIdAPI')
```

*   **`const logger = createLogger('LogsByExecutionIdAPI')`**:
    *   This line initializes a `logger` instance. The string `'LogsByExecutionIdAPI'` is likely used as a label or context for this specific logger, helping to identify which part of the application is generating a log message when you see it in the console. This is crucial for debugging and monitoring.

---

```typescript
export async function GET(
  _request: NextRequest,
  { params }: { params: Promise<{ executionId: string }> }
) {
```

*   **`export async function GET(...)`**:
    *   This defines an `async` function named `GET`. In Next.js, when you create a file like `app/api/workflows/[executionId]/route.ts` (or similar), an exported `GET` function automatically handles HTTP GET requests to that route. The `async` keyword means this function can perform operations that take time (like database queries) without blocking the main program, using `await`.
*   **`_request: NextRequest`**:
    *   This is the first parameter, representing the incoming HTTP request. The underscore (`_`) before `request` is a TypeScript convention indicating that this parameter is received but not directly used within the function body.
*   **`{ params }: { params: Promise<{ executionId: string }> }`**:
    *   This is the second parameter, using object destructuring to extract `params` from the context provided by Next.js.
    *   `params`: This object will contain route parameters. For a route like `app/api/workflows/[executionId]/route.ts`, `executionId` would be a parameter.
    *   `Promise<{ executionId: string }>`: This type annotation indicates that `params` is not just a plain object, but a `Promise` that will eventually resolve to an object containing an `executionId` property (which is a string). This is a common pattern in Next.js 13+ App Router API routes when dealing with dynamic route segments.

---

```typescript
  try {
    const { executionId } = await params

    logger.debug(`Fetching execution data for: ${executionId}`)
```

*   **`try { ... } catch (error) { ... }`**:
    *   This is a standard JavaScript error handling construct. Any code within the `try` block that might throw an error will be "caught" by the `catch` block, preventing the application from crashing and allowing for graceful error responses.
*   **`const { executionId } = await params`**:
    *   Since `params` is a `Promise`, we use `await` to wait for it to resolve. Once resolved, we destructure the resulting object to extract the `executionId` string into a constant variable. This `executionId` is the unique identifier for the workflow run we want to fetch.
*   **`logger.debug(...)`**:
    *   This line uses the previously initialized `logger` to output a debug message. It's helpful for tracing the execution flow during development or debugging, confirming that the function has started and what `executionId` it's working with.

```typescript
    // Get the workflow execution log to find the snapshot
    const [workflowLog] = await db
      .select()
      .from(workflowExecutionLogs)
      .where(eq(workflowExecutionLogs.executionId, executionId))
      .limit(1)
```

*   **`// Get the workflow execution log to find the snapshot`**: A comment explaining the purpose of the following code.
*   **`const [workflowLog] = await db ... .limit(1)`**:
    *   This is the first database query, using Drizzle ORM.
    *   `db.select()`: Starts a select query. By default, it selects all columns (`*`).
    *   `.from(workflowExecutionLogs)`: Specifies that we are querying the `workflowExecutionLogs` table.
    *   `.where(eq(workflowExecutionLogs.executionId, executionId))`: This is the filter condition. It finds rows where the `executionId` column in the `workflowExecutionLogs` table is equal (`eq`) to the `executionId` value we extracted from the URL parameters.
    *   `.limit(1)`: Specifies that we only want to retrieve at most one row. Since `executionId` is usually a unique identifier for logs, we expect only one match.
    *   `await`: Waits for the database query to complete.
    *   `const [workflowLog]`: The `db.select()` method often returns an array of results. By using array destructuring `[workflowLog]`, we extract the *first* item from that array into the `workflowLog` variable. If no results are found, `workflowLog` will be `undefined`.

---

```typescript
    if (!workflowLog) {
      return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Workflow execution not found' }, { status: 404 })
    }
```

*   **`if (!workflowLog)`**:
    *   This checks if `workflowLog` is `undefined` (meaning the previous database query did not find any matching workflow execution log).
*   **`return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Workflow execution not found' }, { status: 404 })`**:
    *   If no log is found, an HTTP 404 (Not Found) response is returned to the client. The response body is a JSON object with an `error` message. This is a standard way to indicate that the requested resource does not exist.

---

```typescript
    // Get the workflow state snapshot
    const [snapshot] = await db
      .select()
      .from(workflowExecutionSnapshots)
      .where(eq(workflowExecutionSnapshots.id, workflowLog.stateSnapshotId))
      .limit(1)
```

*   **`// Get the workflow state snapshot`**: A comment explaining the purpose.
*   **`const [snapshot] = await db ... .limit(1)`**:
    *   This is the second database query. Now that we have the `workflowLog`, it contains a reference (`stateSnapshotId`) to the detailed state snapshot.
    *   `db.select().from(workflowExecutionSnapshots)`: Queries the `workflowExecutionSnapshots` table.
    *   `.where(eq(workflowExecutionSnapshots.id, workflowLog.stateSnapshotId))`: Filters for a snapshot where its `id` matches the `stateSnapshotId` found in the `workflowLog` from the previous query.
    *   `.limit(1)`: Again, we expect only one matching snapshot.
    *   `const [snapshot]`: Extracts the first (and only) result into the `snapshot` variable.

---

```typescript
    if (!snapshot) {
      return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Workflow state snapshot not found' }, { status: 404 })
    }
```

*   **`if (!snapshot)`**:
    *   Similar to the previous check, this verifies if a `snapshot` was found based on the `stateSnapshotId` from the `workflowLog`.
*   **`return NextResponse.json(...)`**:
    *   If no snapshot is found (which could indicate a data inconsistency), an HTTP 404 response is returned with an appropriate error message.

---

```typescript
    const response = {
      executionId,
      workflowId: workflowLog.workflowId,
      workflowState: snapshot.stateData,
      executionMetadata: {
        trigger: workflowLog.trigger,
        startedAt: workflowLog.startedAt.toISOString(),
        endedAt: workflowLog.endedAt?.toISOString(),
        totalDurationMs: workflowLog.totalDurationMs,
        cost: workflowLog.cost || null,
      },
    }
```

*   **`const response = { ... }`**:
    *   If both the `workflowLog` and `snapshot` are successfully retrieved, this block constructs the final JSON response object that will be sent back to the client.
    *   **`executionId`**: The `executionId` from the URL parameter.
    *   **`workflowId: workflowLog.workflowId`**: The ID of the specific workflow definition that was executed, taken from the `workflowLog`.
    *   **`workflowState: snapshot.stateData`**: This is the core detailed state of the workflow, retrieved directly from the `stateData` field of the `snapshot` object. This `stateData` is likely a JSON object or similar structure representing the workflow's internal variables, status, etc.
    *   **`executionMetadata: { ... }`**: An nested object containing additional metadata about the execution.
        *   **`trigger: workflowLog.trigger`**: How the workflow was started (e.g., "manual", "API call", "schedule").
        *   **`startedAt: workflowLog.startedAt.toISOString()`**: The start time of the workflow execution. `.toISOString()` converts the JavaScript `Date` object into a standard ISO 8601 string format, which is universally recognized and good for API responses.
        *   **`endedAt: workflowLog.endedAt?.toISOString()`**: The end time of the workflow execution. The `?.` (optional chaining) is used here because `endedAt` might be `null` or `undefined` if the workflow is still running or failed prematurely. If `endedAt` is null, the result of this expression will be `undefined`.
        *   **`totalDurationMs: workflowLog.totalDurationMs`**: The total duration of the workflow execution in milliseconds.
        *   **`cost: workflowLog.cost || null`**: The cost associated with the workflow execution. `|| null` ensures that if `workflowLog.cost` is `undefined`, `0`, or `null`, it will explicitly become `null` in the response, providing a consistent `null` value instead of `undefined` or `0` if that's the desired behavior for "no cost recorded."

---

```typescript
    logger.debug(`Successfully fetched execution data for: ${executionId}`)
    logger.debug(
      `Workflow state contains ${Object.keys((snapshot.stateData as any)?.blocks || {}).length} blocks`
    )

    return NextResponse.json(response)
```

*   **`logger.debug(...)`**: More debug messages confirming success.
*   **`logger.debug(...)`**: This line provides an additional piece of information about the `workflowState`.
    *   `(snapshot.stateData as any)`: This is a type assertion, telling TypeScript to temporarily treat `stateData` as `any`. This is often necessary when `stateData` is stored as a generic JSON type in the database, and its exact structure (e.g., having a `blocks` property) isn't known to TypeScript at compile time.
    *   `?.blocks`: Uses optional chaining to safely access the `blocks` property on `stateData`. If `stateData` or `stateData.blocks` is null/undefined, it won't throw an error.
    *   `|| {}`: If `blocks` is undefined, it defaults to an empty object `{}`.
    *   `Object.keys(...).length`: This gets an array of the keys (property names) from the `blocks` object and then counts how many there are, effectively telling us how many "blocks" are in the workflow's state. This is useful for understanding the complexity of the workflow state.
*   **`return NextResponse.json(response)`**:
    *   Finally, the constructed `response` object is converted into a JSON string and sent back to the client as an HTTP 200 (OK) response.

---

```typescript
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Error fetching execution data:', error)
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Failed to fetch execution data' }, { status: 500 })
  }
}
```

*   **`} catch (error) { ... }`**:
    *   If any error occurs within the `try` block (e.g., a database connection issue, an unexpected data format), the code execution jumps here.
*   **`logger.error('Error fetching execution data:', error)`**:
    *   The error is logged using the `logger.error` method. This is critical for operational monitoring, as it will highlight that something went wrong during the API request processing. The `error` object itself is logged to provide detailed stack traces or error messages.
*   **`return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Failed to fetch execution data' }, { status: 500 })`**:
    *   An HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error) response is returned to the client. This indicates that something went wrong on the server's side. The response provides a generic error message, avoiding leaking sensitive internal error details to the client.

### **Simplified Complex Logic**

The core logic here is a two-step database lookup:

1.  **Find the "main record" (workflow execution log):** You give it an `executionId` (like a receipt number). It looks in a table called `workflowExecutionLogs` to find the basic details of that specific workflow run.
2.  **Use the main record to find the "detailed state" (snapshot):** The main record contains a special ID called `stateSnapshotId`. This ID acts like a key to another table called `workflowExecutionSnapshots`. The code then uses this key to pull out the full, detailed internal state of the workflow at the moment of execution.

Once both pieces of information are retrieved, they are combined into a clean, easy-to-read JSON object and sent back to whoever made the request. Error handling is in place to catch issues (like IDs not found or database problems) and return appropriate error messages.
