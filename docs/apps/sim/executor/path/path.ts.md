This TypeScript file defines the `PathTracker` class, a critical component for managing the dynamic execution flow within a workflow engine. It determines which blocks are part of the currently active path and updates these paths as blocks are executed.

---

## ðŸ§­ Purpose of this File

The `PathTracker` class is responsible for understanding and manipulating the "active execution path" within a workflow. Imagine a workflow as a roadmap with many possible routes. This class acts as a sophisticated GPS, deciding which roads (blocks) are currently open for travel based on the decisions made by previously executed blocks (like "turn left at the intersection" or "take this specific exit").

Specifically, it handles two main tasks:

1.  **Checking Path Status:** Given a block, it can tell you if that block is currently considered part of the "active" route that the workflow engine should be looking at for execution.
2.  **Updating Paths:** When a block finishes executing, this class updates the active paths, activating new blocks and connections based on the executed block's outcome (e.g., a router block deciding which branch to take, or a condition block evaluating to true). It intelligently handles different types of blocks, such as routers, conditions, loops, and regular processing blocks, ensuring that the path is updated correctly according to their specific logic.

This is essential for ensuring that the workflow executes only the relevant blocks and correctly follows branching logic, error handling, and loop structures.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Simplified Complex Logic

At its core, `PathTracker` works by inspecting the `ExecutionContext`, which holds all the dynamic state of the current workflow run, including which blocks have been `executedBlocks`, which blocks are in the `activeExecutionPath`, and decisions made by `router` and `condition` blocks.

Here's a simplified breakdown:

1.  **Is a Block Active? (`isInActivePath`)**:
    *   First, check if the block is *already* marked as active. If yes, it's active.
    *   Otherwise, look at all the connections *leading into* this block.
    *   If *any* of these incoming connections are "active" (meaning their source block was executed, and the decision made by that source block leads to this connection), then the current block is considered active.
    *   "Active connection" means:
        *   For a **Router block**: The router executed, and *its specific output* matches the target of this connection.
        *   For a **Condition block**: The condition executed, and *its selected condition* matches the handle of this connection.
        *   For a **Regular block**: Its source block executed AND was itself in the active path.

2.  **Update Paths After Execution (`updateExecutionPaths`)**:
    *   When one or more blocks finish executing, this is called.
    *   For *each* executed block:
        *   It first figures out the *original* block ID, as parallel execution can create "virtual block IDs" (e.g., `originalId_parallel_1`). This ensures decisions are associated with the correct logical block.
        *   Then, based on the *type* of the executed block (Router, Condition, Loop, Regular), it applies specific rules to activate new paths:
            *   **Router Blocks**: Reads the router's output to see which path it selected. It then adds the *selected target block* to the active path and sometimes recursively activates *downstream regular blocks* from that target.
            *   **Condition Blocks**: Reads the condition's output to see which condition branch was met. It then finds the connections matching that branch and adds their *target blocks* to the active path, recursively activating *downstream regular blocks* from them.
            *   **Loop Blocks**: When a loop block itself executes, it primarily activates the connection that leads *into the loop body* (`loop-start-source`). Other loop-related pathing is usually handled by a separate loop manager.
            *   **Regular Blocks**: For standard blocks, it considers all outgoing connections. It checks if the block had an error (activating error paths) or completed successfully (activating normal paths). It might also skip external connections if the block is *inside an active loop* that hasn't finished yet. Any valid outgoing connection's target is added to the active path.

3.  **Preventing Over-activation (`activateDownstreamPathsSelectively`)**:
    *   When a router or condition block picks a path, or a regular block activates its next step, it doesn't blindly activate *all* subsequent blocks.
    *   It only recursively activates "regular" blocks immediately downstream.
    *   If a routing block (another router or condition) or a flow control block (like a loop or parallel block) is encountered, it stops the recursive activation. This is because these special blocks are responsible for making their *own* decisions and activating *their own* downstream paths when they eventually execute. This prevents premature activation of paths that might later be deselected.

In essence, `PathTracker` uses the `ExecutionContext` to store and retrieve decisions and states, allowing it to accurately model the flow of a complex workflow, ensuring only the truly relevant blocks are considered for the next step.

## ðŸ“– Line-by-Line Explanation

Let's break down the code:

### Imports

```typescript
import { createLogger } from '@/lib/logs/console/logger'
import { BlockType } from '@/executor/consts'
import { Routing } from '@/executor/routing/routing'
import type { BlockState, ExecutionContext } from '@/executor/types'
import { ConnectionUtils } from '@/executor/utils/connections'
import { VirtualBlockUtils } from '@/executor/utils/virtual-blocks'
import type { SerializedBlock, SerializedConnection, SerializedWorkflow } from '@/serializer/types'
```

*   `import { createLogger } from '@/lib/logs/console/logger'`: Imports a utility to create a logger instance, used here for debugging and informational messages specific to path tracking.
*   `import { BlockType } from '@/executor/consts'`: Imports an enum or object containing predefined types for different kinds of blocks (e.g., `ROUTER`, `LOOP`). This helps identify block behavior.
*   `import { Routing } from '@/executor/routing/routing'`: Imports a utility class or object that encapsulates routing-specific logic, such as determining a block's category or if a connection should be skipped.
*   `import type { BlockState, ExecutionContext } from '@/executor/types'`: Imports TypeScript types for `BlockState` (the output and status of a single block's execution) and `ExecutionContext` (the overall state of the workflow's execution, including decisions, active paths, executed blocks, etc.). `type` keyword ensures these are only used for type checking and not bundled into the JavaScript output.
*   `import { ConnectionUtils } from '@/executor/utils/connections'`: Imports a utility class for working with workflow connections, such as finding incoming or outgoing connections for a block.
*   `import { VirtualBlockUtils } from '@/executor/utils/virtual-blocks'`: Imports a utility class for handling "virtual block IDs," which are used when a single logical block is executed multiple times in parallel or iterations (e.g., within a loop).
*   `import type { SerializedBlock, SerializedConnection, SerializedWorkflow } from '@/serializer/types'`: Imports TypeScript types representing the static structure of the workflow: `SerializedBlock` (a single block's definition), `SerializedConnection` (a connection between two blocks), and `SerializedWorkflow` (the entire workflow definition, including all blocks and connections).

### Logger Instance

```typescript
const logger = createLogger('PathTracker')
```

*   `const logger = createLogger('PathTracker')`: Creates a logger instance specifically named 'PathTracker'. This allows logging messages to be filtered or identified as coming from this class.

### PathTracker Class Definition

```typescript
/**
 * Manages the active execution paths in the workflow.
 * Tracks which blocks should be executed based on routing decisions.
 */
export class PathTracker {
  constructor(private workflow: SerializedWorkflow) {}
```

*   `export class PathTracker {`: Declares the `PathTracker` class, making it available for use in other files.
*   `constructor(private workflow: SerializedWorkflow) {}`: The constructor for the `PathTracker` class.
    *   `private workflow: SerializedWorkflow`: It takes a `SerializedWorkflow` object as a parameter. The `private` keyword automatically creates a private class property named `workflow` and assigns the passed value to it. This `workflow` object contains the static definition of all blocks and connections in the workflow, which `PathTracker` needs to traverse.

### `isInActivePath` Method

```typescript
  /**
   * Checks if a block is in the active execution path.
   * Considers router and condition block decisions.
   *
   * @param blockId - ID of the block to check
   * @param context - Current execution context
   * @returns Whether the block is in the active execution path
   */
  isInActivePath(blockId: string, context: ExecutionContext): boolean {
    // Early return if already in active path
    if (context.activeExecutionPath.has(blockId)) {
      return true
    }

    // Get all incoming connections to this block
    const incomingConnections = this.getIncomingConnections(blockId)

    // A block is in the active path if at least one of its incoming connections
    // is from an active and executed block
    return incomingConnections.some((conn) => this.isConnectionActive(conn, context))
  }
```

*   `isInActivePath(blockId: string, context: ExecutionContext): boolean {`: Defines a public method that checks if a given `blockId` is part of the `activeExecutionPath`. It takes the block's ID and the current `ExecutionContext`.
*   `if (context.activeExecutionPath.has(blockId)) { return true }`: This is an optimization. If the `blockId` is already present in the `activeExecutionPath` Set (which holds all currently active blocks), we immediately know it's active and return `true`.
*   `const incomingConnections = this.getIncomingConnections(blockId)`: Retrieves all connections that lead *into* the specified `blockId` using a private helper method.
*   `return incomingConnections.some((conn) => this.isConnectionActive(conn, context))`: This is the core logic. It checks if *any* of the `incomingConnections` are active. The `some()` method returns `true` if at least one connection satisfies the condition defined by `this.isConnectionActive()`, otherwise `false`. If any incoming connection is active, it means the current block is reachable and therefore active.

### `updateExecutionPaths` Method

```typescript
  /**
   * Updates execution paths based on newly executed blocks.
   * Handles router and condition block decisions to activate paths without deactivating others.
   * Supports both original block IDs and virtual block IDs (for parallel execution).
   *
   * @param executedBlockIds - IDs of blocks that were just executed (may include virtual IDs)
   * @param context - Current execution context
   */
  updateExecutionPaths(executedBlockIds: string[], context: ExecutionContext): void {
    for (const blockId of executedBlockIds) {
      // Handle virtual block IDs from parallel execution
      const originalBlockId = this.extractOriginalBlockId(blockId)
      const block = this.getBlock(originalBlockId)
      if (!block) continue

      // Set currentVirtualBlockId so decision setting uses the correct key
      const previousVirtualBlockId = context.currentVirtualBlockId
      if (blockId !== originalBlockId) {
        context.currentVirtualBlockId = blockId
      }

      this.updatePathForBlock(block, context)

      // Restore previous virtual block ID
      context.currentVirtualBlockId = previousVirtualBlockId
    }
  }
```

*   `updateExecutionPaths(executedBlockIds: string[], context: ExecutionContext): void {`: This public method is called after one or more blocks have finished executing. It takes an array of `executedBlockIds` (which might include virtual IDs) and the `ExecutionContext`.
*   `for (const blockId of executedBlockIds) { ... }`: It iterates through each `blockId` that was just executed.
*   `const originalBlockId = this.extractOriginalBlockId(blockId)`: If `blockId` is a virtual ID (e.g., `myBlock_parallel_1`), this extracts the original `myBlock` ID. This is crucial for retrieving the correct block definition from the `workflow`.
*   `const block = this.getBlock(originalBlockId)`: Retrieves the actual `SerializedBlock` object using the `originalBlockId`.
*   `if (!block) continue`: If the block definition isn't found (shouldn't happen in a valid workflow, but good for safety), it skips to the next executed block.
*   `const previousVirtualBlockId = context.currentVirtualBlockId`: Stores the `currentVirtualBlockId` from the context. This is important if multiple virtual blocks are being processed in a single `updateExecutionPaths` call or if there's nested parallel execution.
*   `if (blockId !== originalBlockId) { context.currentVirtualBlockId = blockId }`: If the `blockId` is indeed a virtual ID, it sets `context.currentVirtualBlockId` to this virtual ID. This ensures that any decisions or state updates made by `updatePathForBlock` are correctly associated with *this specific instance* of the virtual block, not just its original definition.
*   `this.updatePathForBlock(block, context)`: Calls a private helper method to perform the actual path update logic for the current block, based on its type and outcome.
*   `context.currentVirtualBlockId = previousVirtualBlockId`: After processing the current block, it restores the `context.currentVirtualBlockId` to its previous value, ensuring that subsequent operations in the loop or other parts of the system aren't affected by the temporary change.

### Private Helper Methods (Utility)

```typescript
  /**
   * Extract original block ID from virtual block ID.
   * Virtual block IDs have format: originalId_parallel_parallelId_iteration_N
   *
   * @param blockId - Block ID (may be virtual or original)
   * @returns Original block ID
   */
  private extractOriginalBlockId(blockId: string): string {
    return VirtualBlockUtils.extractOriginalId(blockId)
  }

  /**
   * Get all incoming connections to a block
   */
  private getIncomingConnections(blockId: string): SerializedConnection[] {
    return ConnectionUtils.getIncomingConnections(blockId, this.workflow.connections)
  }

  /**
   * Get all outgoing connections from a block
   */
  private getOutgoingConnections(blockId: string): SerializedConnection[] {
    return ConnectionUtils.getOutgoingConnections(blockId, this.workflow.connections)
  }

  /**
   * Get a block by ID
   */
  private getBlock(blockId: string): SerializedBlock | undefined {
    return this.workflow.blocks.find((b) => b.id === blockId)
  }
```

*   `private extractOriginalBlockId(blockId: string): string { ... }`: Delegates to `VirtualBlockUtils.extractOriginalId` to get the base ID for a block that might have a virtual ID suffix.
*   `private getIncomingConnections(blockId: string): SerializedConnection[] { ... }`: Delegates to `ConnectionUtils.getIncomingConnections` to find all connections where `target` matches `blockId`. It passes the full list of `this.workflow.connections`.
*   `private getOutgoingConnections(blockId: string): SerializedConnection[] { ... }`: Delegates to `ConnectionUtils.getOutgoingConnections` to find all connections where `source` matches `blockId`.
*   `private getBlock(blockId: string): SerializedBlock | undefined { ... }`: Finds a `SerializedBlock` object within `this.workflow.blocks` by its `id`. Returns `undefined` if not found.

### `isConnectionActive` Method and Variants

```typescript
  /**
   * Check if a connection is active based on its source block type and state
   */
  private isConnectionActive(connection: SerializedConnection, context: ExecutionContext): boolean {
    const sourceBlock = this.getBlock(connection.source)
    if (!sourceBlock) return false

    const blockType = sourceBlock.metadata?.id || ''
    const category = Routing.getCategory(blockType)

    // Use routing strategy to determine connection checking method
    switch (category) {
      case 'routing':
        return blockType === BlockType.ROUTER
          ? this.isRouterConnectionActive(connection, context)
          : this.isConditionConnectionActive(connection, context)
      default:
        return this.isRegularConnectionActive(connection, context)
    }
  }

  /**
   * Check if a router connection is active
   */
  private isRouterConnectionActive(
    connection: SerializedConnection,
    context: ExecutionContext
  ): boolean {
    const selectedTarget = context.decisions.router.get(connection.source)
    return context.executedBlocks.has(connection.source) && selectedTarget === connection.target
  }

  /**
   * Check if a condition connection is active
   */
  private isConditionConnectionActive(
    connection: SerializedConnection,
    context: ExecutionContext
  ): boolean {
    if (!connection.sourceHandle?.startsWith('condition-')) {
      return false
    }

    const conditionId = connection.sourceHandle.replace('condition-', '')
    const selectedCondition = context.decisions.condition.get(connection.source)

    return context.executedBlocks.has(connection.source) && conditionId === selectedCondition
  }

  /**
   * Check if a regular connection is active
   */
  private isRegularConnectionActive(
    connection: SerializedConnection,
    context: ExecutionContext
  ): boolean {
    return (
      context.activeExecutionPath.has(connection.source) &&
      context.executedBlocks.has(connection.source)
    )
  }
```

*   `private isConnectionActive(connection: SerializedConnection, context: ExecutionContext): boolean {`: Determines if a given `connection` is currently active.
    *   `const sourceBlock = this.getBlock(connection.source)`: Gets the block that initiates this connection.
    *   `if (!sourceBlock) return false`: If the source block isn't found, the connection cannot be active.
    *   `const blockType = sourceBlock.metadata?.id || ''`: Extracts the specific `BlockType` (e.g., `ROUTER`, `CONDITION`) from the source block's metadata.
    *   `const category = Routing.getCategory(blockType)`: Uses the `Routing` utility to determine a broader `category` for the block type (e.g., 'routing', 'flow-control', 'regular').
    *   `switch (category) { ... }`: Uses a `switch` statement to apply different logic based on the block's category.
        *   `case 'routing':`: If the source block is a routing type (Router or Condition).
            *   `return blockType === BlockType.ROUTER ? ... : ...`: Further distinguishes between `ROUTER` and other routing blocks (implicitly `CONDITION` blocks in this context).
            *   `this.isRouterConnectionActive(connection, context)`: Calls a specialized method for router connections.
            *   `this.isConditionConnectionActive(connection, context)`: Calls a specialized method for condition connections.
        *   `default:`: For all other block categories (e.g., 'regular', 'flow-control' other than specific routing types).
            *   `return this.isRegularConnectionActive(connection, context)`: Calls a general method for regular connections.

*   `private isRouterConnectionActive(...)`:
    *   `const selectedTarget = context.decisions.router.get(connection.source)`: Retrieves the target block ID that the router at `connection.source` decided to route to. This decision is stored in `context.decisions.router` when the router executes.
    *   `return context.executedBlocks.has(connection.source) && selectedTarget === connection.target`: The connection is active if the source router block has been executed AND its decision (`selectedTarget`) matches the actual `target` of this specific connection.

*   `private isConditionConnectionActive(...)`:
    *   `if (!connection.sourceHandle?.startsWith('condition-')) { return false }`: Ensures the connection's `sourceHandle` is relevant for a condition block (e.g., `condition-true`, `condition-false`).
    *   `const conditionId = connection.sourceHandle.replace('condition-', '')`: Extracts the specific condition ID (e.g., 'true', 'false', or a custom condition name) from the handle.
    *   `const selectedCondition = context.decisions.condition.get(connection.source)`: Retrieves the condition ID that the condition block at `connection.source` evaluated to.
    *   `return context.executedBlocks.has(connection.source) && conditionId === selectedCondition`: The connection is active if the source condition block has been executed AND its evaluated condition (`selectedCondition`) matches the `conditionId` of this connection's handle.

*   `private isRegularConnectionActive(...)`:
    *   `return context.activeExecutionPath.has(connection.source) && context.executedBlocks.has(connection.source)`: For regular blocks, a connection is active if its source block was part of the `activeExecutionPath` (i.e., reachable) AND it has actually `executedBlocks`.

### `updatePathForBlock` Method and Variants

```typescript
  /**
   * Update paths for a specific block based on its type
   */
  private updatePathForBlock(block: SerializedBlock, context: ExecutionContext): void {
    const blockType = block.metadata?.id || ''

          this.updateRouterPaths(block, context)
        } else {
          this.updateConditionPaths(block, context)
        }
        break
      case 'flow-control':
        if (blockType === BlockType.LOOP) {
          this.updateLoopPaths(block, context)
        } else {
          // For parallel blocks, they're handled by their own handler
          this.updateRegularBlockPaths(block, context)
        }
        break
      default:
        this.updateRegularBlockPaths(block, context)
        break
    }
  }

  /**
   * Update paths for router blocks
   */
  private updateRouterPaths(block: SerializedBlock, context: ExecutionContext): void {
    const blockStateKey = context.currentVirtualBlockId || block.id
    const routerOutput = context.blockStates.get(blockStateKey)?.output
    const selectedPath = routerOutput?.selectedPath?.blockId

    if (selectedPath) {
      const decisionKey = context.currentVirtualBlockId || block.id
      if (!context.decisions.router.has(decisionKey)) {
        context.decisions.router.set(decisionKey, selectedPath)
      }
      context.activeExecutionPath.add(selectedPath)

      // Check if the selected target should activate downstream paths
      const selectedBlock = this.getBlock(selectedPath)
      const selectedBlockType = selectedBlock?.metadata?.id || ''
      const selectedCategory = Routing.getCategory(selectedBlockType)

      // Only activate downstream paths for regular blocks
      // Routing blocks make their own routing decisions when they execute
      // Flow control blocks manage their own path activation
      if (selectedCategory === 'regular') {
        this.activateDownstreamPathsSelectively(selectedPath, context)
      }

      logger.info(`Router ${block.id} selected path: ${selectedPath}`)
    }
  }
```

*   `private updatePathForBlock(block: SerializedBlock, context: ExecutionContext): void {`: This method serves as a dispatcher, directing the path update logic to specific handlers based on the block's type and category.
    *   `const blockType = block.metadata?.id || ''`: Gets the specific type of the block.
    *   `const category = Routing.getCategory(blockType)`: Determines the broader category of the block.
    *   `switch (category) { ... }`:
        *   `case 'routing':`: If it's a routing block.
            *   `if (blockType === BlockType.ROUTER) { this.updateRouterPaths(block, context) }`: Calls the router-specific handler.
            *   `else { this.updateConditionPaths(block, context) }`: Calls the condition-specific handler (assuming other routing blocks are conditions).
        *   `case 'flow-control':`: If it's a flow control block.
            *   `if (blockType === BlockType.LOOP) { this.updateLoopPaths(block, context) }`: Calls the loop-specific handler.
            *   `else { ... this.updateRegularBlockPaths(block, context) }`: For other flow control blocks (like parallel blocks), it mentions they are handled separately and then falls back to `updateRegularBlockPaths`. This indicates that `PathTracker` might not fully control parallel block pathing, or parallel blocks are treated similarly to regular blocks in terms of *their immediate* outgoing connections *after* they manage their internal parallel logic.
        *   `default:`: For all other block types (regular blocks).
            *   `this.updateRegularBlockPaths(block, context)`: Calls the general handler for regular blocks.

*   `private updateRouterPaths(block: SerializedBlock, context: ExecutionContext): void {`: Handles path updates specifically for `ROUTER` blocks.
    *   `const blockStateKey = context.currentVirtualBlockId || block.id`: Determines the key to look up block state. If a virtual block ID is currently set in the context, use that; otherwise, use the original block ID.
    *   `const routerOutput = context.blockStates.get(blockStateKey)?.output`: Retrieves the output of the executed router block from the `context.blockStates` map.
    *   `const selectedPath = routerOutput?.selectedPath?.blockId`: Extracts the `blockId` of the path chosen by the router from its output.
    *   `if (selectedPath) { ... }`: Proceeds only if a path was actually selected.
        *   `const decisionKey = context.currentVirtualBlockId || block.id`: Gets the correct key (virtual or original) to store the decision.
        *   `if (!context.decisions.router.has(decisionKey)) { context.decisions.router.set(decisionKey, selectedPath) }`: Stores the router's decision in `context.decisions.router`. This is essential for `isRouterConnectionActive` to work later. It only stores if not already present, ensuring idempotency.
        *   `context.activeExecutionPath.add(selectedPath)`: Adds the block selected by the router to the `activeExecutionPath`. This block is now considered active and eligible for execution.
        *   `const selectedBlock = this.getBlock(selectedPath)`: Gets the definition of the newly activated block.
        *   `const selectedBlockType = selectedBlock?.metadata?.id || ''`: Gets its type.
        *   `const selectedCategory = Routing.getCategory(selectedBlockType)`: Gets its category.
        *   `if (selectedCategory === 'regular') { this.activateDownstreamPathsSelectively(selectedPath, context) }`: **Crucial selective activation logic.** If the *selected block* is a "regular" block, it recursively calls `activateDownstreamPathsSelectively` to activate subsequent *regular* blocks. It explicitly skips activating downstream if the selected block itself is a routing block or flow control block, as those blocks are responsible for their *own* path activation when they execute.
        *   `logger.info(...)`: Logs the router's decision.

### `activateDownstreamPathsSelectively` Method

```typescript
  /**
   * Selectively activate downstream paths, respecting block routing behavior
   * This prevents flow control blocks from being activated when they should be controlled by routing
   */
  private activateDownstreamPathsSelectively(blockId: string, context: ExecutionContext): void {
    const outgoingConnections = this.getOutgoingConnections(blockId)

    for (const conn of outgoingConnections) {
      if (!context.activeExecutionPath.has(conn.target)) {
        const targetBlock = this.getBlock(conn.target)
        const targetBlockType = targetBlock?.metadata?.id

        // Use routing strategy to determine if this connection should be activated
        if (!Routing.shouldSkipConnection(conn.sourceHandle, targetBlockType || '')) {
          context.activeExecutionPath.add(conn.target)

          // Recursively activate downstream paths if the target block should activate downstream
          if (Routing.shouldActivateDownstream(targetBlockType || '')) {
            this.activateDownstreamPathsSelectively(conn.target, context)
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

*   `private activateDownstreamPathsSelectively(blockId: string, context: ExecutionContext): void {`: A recursive helper method to activate blocks further down the path, but with specific rules.
*   `const outgoingConnections = this.getOutgoingConnections(blockId)`: Gets all connections leading out of the current `blockId`.
*   `for (const conn of outgoingConnections) { ... }`: Iterates through each outgoing connection.
*   `if (!context.activeExecutionPath.has(conn.target)) { ... }`: Only processes connections whose target is *not already* in the active path, to prevent infinite loops in cyclic graphs and redundant additions.
    *   `const targetBlock = this.getBlock(conn.target)`: Gets the block definition for the target of this connection.
    *   `const targetBlockType = targetBlock?.metadata?.id`: Gets the type of the target block.
    *   `if (!Routing.shouldSkipConnection(conn.sourceHandle, targetBlockType || '')) { ... }`: Uses `Routing` utility to determine if this specific connection should be skipped. For example, an "error" output handle from a block might be skipped if there's no error.
        *   `context.activeExecutionPath.add(conn.target)`: If not skipped, the target block is added to the `activeExecutionPath`.
        *   `if (Routing.shouldActivateDownstream(targetBlockType || '')) { this.activateDownstreamPathsSelectively(conn.target, context) }`: **Key recursive step.** If the *target block's type* indicates that it *should* automatically activate its own downstream paths (i.e., it's a "regular" block), then this method calls itself recursively with the `conn.target` as the new `blockId`. This stops when a routing block or flow control block is encountered.

### `updateConditionPaths` Method

```typescript
  /**
   * Update paths for condition blocks
   */
  private updateConditionPaths(block: SerializedBlock, context: ExecutionContext): void {
    // Read block state using the correct ID (virtual ID if in parallel execution, otherwise original ID)
    const blockStateKey = context.currentVirtualBlockId || block.id
    const conditionOutput = context.blockStates.get(blockStateKey)?.output
    const selectedConditionId = conditionOutput?.selectedConditionId

    if (!selectedConditionId) return

    const decisionKey = context.currentVirtualBlockId || block.id
    if (!context.decisions.condition.has(decisionKey)) {
      context.decisions.condition.set(decisionKey, selectedConditionId)
    }

    const targetConnections = this.workflow.connections.filter(
      (conn) => conn.source === block.id && conn.sourceHandle === `condition-${selectedConditionId}`
    )

    for (const conn of targetConnections) {
      context.activeExecutionPath.add(conn.target)
      logger.debug(`Condition ${block.id} activated path to: ${conn.target}`)

      // Check if the selected target should activate downstream paths
      const selectedBlock = this.getBlock(conn.target)
      const selectedBlockType = selectedBlock?.metadata?.id || ''
      const selectedCategory = Routing.getCategory(selectedBlockType)

      // Only activate downstream paths for regular blocks
      // Routing blocks make their own routing decisions when they execute
      // Flow control blocks manage their own path activation
      if (selectedCategory === 'regular') {
        this.activateDownstreamPathsSelectively(conn.target, context)
      }
    }
  }
```

*   `private updateConditionPaths(block: SerializedBlock, context: ExecutionContext): void {`: Handles path updates for condition blocks, similar to routers.
    *   `const blockStateKey = context.currentVirtualBlockId || block.id`: Gets the key for `blockStates`.
    *   `const conditionOutput = context.blockStates.get(blockStateKey)?.output`: Retrieves the output of the executed condition block.
    *   `const selectedConditionId = conditionOutput?.selectedConditionId`: Extracts the ID of the condition that evaluated to true (e.g., 'true', 'false').
    *   `if (!selectedConditionId) return`: If no condition was selected (e.g., block failed), return early.
    *   `const decisionKey = context.currentVirtualBlockId || block.id`: Gets the key for `decisions`.
    *   `if (!context.decisions.condition.has(decisionKey)) { context.decisions.condition.set(decisionKey, selectedConditionId) }`: Stores the condition's decision in `context.decisions.condition`.
    *   `const targetConnections = this.workflow.connections.filter(...)`: Finds all connections originating from this condition block where the `sourceHandle` matches the `selectedConditionId` (e.g., `condition-true`).
    *   `for (const conn of targetConnections) { ... }`: Iterates through these matching connections.
        *   `context.activeExecutionPath.add(conn.target)`: Adds the target block of each matching connection to the `activeExecutionPath`.
        *   `logger.debug(...)`: Logs the activation.
        *   `if (selectedCategory === 'regular') { this.activateDownstreamPathsSelectively(conn.target, context) }`: Similar to router, selectively activates downstream *regular* blocks from the condition's chosen path.

### `updateLoopPaths` Method

```typescript
  /**
   * Update paths for loop blocks
   */
  private updateLoopPaths(block: SerializedBlock, context: ExecutionContext): void {
    const outgoingConnections = this.getOutgoingConnections(block.id)

    for (const conn of outgoingConnections) {
      // Only activate loop-start connections
      if (conn.sourceHandle === 'loop-start-source') {
        context.activeExecutionPath.add(conn.target)
        logger.info(`Loop ${block.id} activated start path to: ${conn.target}`)
      }
      // loop-end-source connections will be activated by the loop manager
    }
  }
```

*   `private updateLoopPaths(block: SerializedBlock, context: ExecutionContext): void {`: Handles path updates for `LOOP` blocks.
*   `const outgoingConnections = this.getOutgoingConnections(block.id)`: Gets outgoing connections.
*   `for (const conn of outgoingConnections) { ... }`: Iterates connections.
*   `if (conn.sourceHandle === 'loop-start-source') { ... }`: Specifically looks for connections emanating from the loop block's "start" handle. This connection leads into the body of the loop.
    *   `context.activeExecutionPath.add(conn.target)`: Adds the block at the start of the loop body to the active path.
    *   `logger.info(...)`: Logs this activation.
*   `// loop-end-source connections will be activated by the loop manager`: A comment indicating that connections exiting the loop (`loop-end-source`) are not managed by `PathTracker` itself, but by a higher-level "loop manager" (not shown in this file). This is a good separation of concerns.

### `updateRegularBlockPaths` Method

```typescript
  /**
   * Update paths for regular blocks
   */
  private updateRegularBlockPaths(block: SerializedBlock, context: ExecutionContext): void {
    // Read block state using the correct ID (virtual ID if in parallel execution, otherwise original ID)
    const blockStateKey = context.currentVirtualBlockId || block.id
    const blockState = context.blockStates.get(blockStateKey)
    const hasError = this.blockHasError(blockState)
    const outgoingConnections = this.getOutgoingConnections(block.id)

    // Check if block is part of loops
    const blockLoops = this.getBlockLoops(block.id, context)
    const isPartOfLoop = blockLoops.length > 0

    for (const conn of outgoingConnections) {
      if (this.shouldActivateConnection(conn, hasError, isPartOfLoop, blockLoops, context)) {
        const targetBlock = this.getBlock(conn.target)
        const targetBlockType = targetBlock?.metadata?.id

        // Use routing strategy to determine if this connection should be activated
        if (Routing.shouldSkipConnection(conn.sourceHandle, targetBlockType || '')) {
          continue
        }

        context.activeExecutionPath.add(conn.target)
      }
    }
  }
```

*   `private updateRegularBlockPaths(block: SerializedBlock, context: ExecutionContext): void {`: Handles path updates for most non-routing, non-flow-control blocks.
    *   `const blockStateKey = context.currentVirtualBlockId || block.id`: Gets the key for `blockStates`.
    *   `const blockState = context.blockStates.get(blockStateKey)`: Retrieves the state of the executed block.
    *   `const hasError = this.blockHasError(blockState)`: Checks if the block's execution resulted in an error.
    *   `const outgoingConnections = this.getOutgoingConnections(block.id)`: Gets all outgoing connections.
    *   `const blockLoops = this.getBlockLoops(block.id, context)`: Identifies if this block is part of any active loops in the workflow definition.
    *   `const isPartOfLoop = blockLoops.length > 0`: Flag indicating if the block belongs to a loop.
    *   `for (const conn of outgoingConnections) { ... }`: Iterates through each outgoing connection.
        *   `if (this.shouldActivateConnection(conn, hasError, isPartOfLoop, blockLoops, context)) { ... }`: Calls a helper method `shouldActivateConnection` to determine if this specific connection should be activated, considering errors and loop context.
            *   `const targetBlock = this.getBlock(conn.target)`: Gets the target block definition.
            *   `const targetBlockType = targetBlock?.metadata?.id`: Gets the target block's type.
            *   `if (Routing.shouldSkipConnection(conn.sourceHandle, targetBlockType || '')) { continue }`: Uses the `Routing` utility to see if this specific connection (based on its `sourceHandle` and the `targetBlockType`) should be skipped *before* activating it. This is another layer of filtering, e.g., if a connection is explicitly disabled.
            *   `context.activeExecutionPath.add(conn.target)`: If all checks pass, the target block is added to the `activeExecutionPath`.

### Helper Methods for `updateRegularBlockPaths`

```typescript
  /**
   * Check if a block has an error
   */
  private blockHasError(blockState: BlockState | undefined): boolean {
    return blockState?.output?.error !== undefined
  }

  /**
   * Get loops that contain a block
   */
  private getBlockLoops(
    blockId: string,
    context: ExecutionContext
  ): Array<{ id: string; loop: any }> {
    return Object.entries(context.workflow?.loops || {})
      .filter(([_, loop]) => loop.nodes.includes(blockId))
      .map(([id, loop]) => ({ id, loop }))
  }

  /**
   * Determine if a connection should be activated
   */
  private shouldActivateConnection(
    conn: SerializedConnection,
    hasError: boolean,
    isPartOfLoop: boolean,
    blockLoops: Array<{ id: string; loop: any }>,
    context: ExecutionContext
  ): boolean {
    // Check if this is an external loop connection
    if (isPartOfLoop) {
      const isInternalConnection = blockLoops.some(({ loop }) => loop.nodes.includes(conn.target))
      const isExternalConnection = !isInternalConnection
      const allLoopsCompleted = blockLoops.every(({ id }) => context.completedLoops?.has(id))

      // Skip external connections unless all loops are completed
      if (isExternalConnection && !allLoopsCompleted) {
        return false
      }
    }

    // Handle error connections
    if (conn.sourceHandle === 'error') {
      return hasError
    }

    // Handle regular connections
    if (conn.sourceHandle === 'source' || !conn.sourceHandle) {
      return !hasError
    }

    // All other connection types are activated
    return true
  }
```

*   `private blockHasError(blockState: BlockState | undefined): boolean { ... }`: A simple check to see if the `blockState` indicates an error.
*   `private getBlockLoops(blockId: string, context: ExecutionContext): Array<{ id: string; loop: any }> { ... }`: This method identifies all loops (from `context.workflow.loops`) that explicitly list the given `blockId` as one of their nodes. It returns an array of objects, each containing the loop's `id` and its `loop` definition.
*   `private shouldActivateConnection(...)`: This method encapsulates the complex logic for deciding if a particular `connection` should be activated.
    *   `if (isPartOfLoop) { ... }`: If the `block` is part of a loop.
        *   `const isInternalConnection = blockLoops.some(({ loop }) => loop.nodes.includes(conn.target))`: Checks if the connection's `target` is *also* inside one of the same loops.
        *   `const isExternalConnection = !isInternalConnection`: If the target is not in the loop, it's an "external" connection, potentially exiting the loop.
        *   `const allLoopsCompleted = blockLoops.every(({ id }) => context.completedLoops?.has(id))`: Checks if *all* loops that this block belongs to have been marked as `completedLoops` in the `context`.
        *   `if (isExternalConnection && !allLoopsCompleted) { return false }`: **Critical loop logic**: An external connection (trying to exit a loop) should *not* be activated unless *all* relevant loops containing the current block have completed. This prevents premature exit from loops.
    *   `if (conn.sourceHandle === 'error') { return hasError }`: If the connection handle is specifically 'error', it should only be activated if the block actually `hasError`.
    *   `if (conn.sourceHandle === 'source' || !conn.sourceHandle) { return !hasError }`: If it's a regular output connection ('source' or no handle), it should only be activated if the block `!hasError`.
    *   `return true`: For any other specific `sourceHandle` (e.g., custom handles that aren't 'error' or 'source'), the connection is activated by default.
