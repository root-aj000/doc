This TypeScript file defines a comprehensive set of interfaces that form the backbone of a sophisticated workflow execution engine. It's designed for systems that orchestrate various "blocks" (individual tasks or operations) into a coherent workflow, likely in domains such as AI agent orchestration, low-code automation platforms, or data pipelines.

The interfaces standardize how blocks communicate, how execution state is managed, how results are logged, and how external tools are integrated. This standardization is crucial for building a flexible, extensible, and debuggable system.

### Purpose of this file

This file primarily serves as a **type definition file (`.d.ts` implicitly, or just a `.ts` file containing only interfaces)**. Its main goal is to declare the structure of data objects and contracts for components involved in:

1.  **Workflow Definition**: How individual blocks and the overall workflow are structured.
2.  **Workflow Execution**: The runtime state, context, and environment during a workflow run.
3.  **Input/Output Standardization**: Defining consistent formats for data exchanged between blocks and the system.
4.  **Logging and Monitoring**: Structures for recording execution history and metadata.
5.  **Extensibility**: Interfaces for integrating custom block logic (handlers) and external functionalities (tools).
6.  **Streaming**: Support for real-time, incremental output delivery.

By defining these interfaces, the system ensures type safety, improves code readability, and provides a clear contract for developers implementing or interacting with the workflow engine.

### Imports Explained

The file starts with `import type` statements. `import type` is a TypeScript-specific syntax used when you only need to import *types* or *interfaces* from another module, not actual runtime code (like classes or functions). This helps ensure that these imports are completely removed during compilation to JavaScript, preventing accidental bundling of unused code.

*   `import type { TraceSpan } from '@/lib/logs/types'`
    *   Imports the `TraceSpan` type. This suggests integration with a logging or tracing system (like OpenTelemetry) where `TraceSpan` represents a unit of work or an operation within a trace. It's used later in `NormalizedBlockOutput` for child workflow introspection.
*   `import type { BlockOutput } from '@/blocks/types'`
    *   Imports the `BlockOutput` type. This likely represents the *raw* output produced by a block before it's processed or normalized into the standardized `NormalizedBlockOutput` format.
*   `import type { SerializedBlock, SerializedWorkflow } from '@/serializer/types'`
    *   Imports `SerializedBlock` and `SerializedWorkflow` types. These typically represent the persistent, often JSON-serializable, definitions of a block and an entire workflow, respectively. They describe *how* a block/workflow is configured, rather than its runtime state.

### Detailed Explanation of Each Interface

Let's break down each interface:

#### `UserFile`

```typescript
export interface UserFile {
  id: string
  name: string
  url: string
  size: number
  type: string
  key: string
  uploadedAt: string
  expiresAt: string
}
```

*   **Purpose**: This interface defines a simplified, user-friendly representation of a file. It's used when blocks in a workflow need to handle binary files or attachments, providing a consistent structure for their metadata.
*   **Properties**:
    *   **`id`**: A unique identifier for the file.
    *   **`name`**: The human-readable name of the file (e.g., "report.pdf").
    *   **`url`**: A URL where the file can be accessed or downloaded.
    *   **`size`**: The size of the file in bytes.
    *   **`type`**: The MIME type of the file (e.g., "application/pdf", "image/jpeg").
    *   **`key`**: Often refers to a storage key or path within a cloud storage service (e.g., S3 key).
    *   **`uploadedAt`**: An ISO timestamp indicating when the file was uploaded.
    *   **`expiresAt`**: An ISO timestamp indicating when the file's access link or the file itself might expire.

#### `NormalizedBlockOutput`

```typescript
export interface NormalizedBlockOutput {
  [key: string]: any
  // ... other properties ...
}
```

*   **Purpose**: This is a critical interface that defines a **standardized output format** for any block executed within the workflow. Regardless of what a specific block (e.g., an LLM block, an API call block, a code execution block) does, its output is expected to conform to this structure. This standardization is vital for ensuring compatibility and predictable data flow between different types of blocks.
*   **Simplifying Complex Logic**: Instead of each block returning a completely unique data structure, this interface provides common fields for various output types (text, files, routing decisions, API responses, errors). This allows the workflow engine to easily parse and route data, and for other blocks to expect predictable input.
*   **Properties**:
    *   **`[key: string]: any`**: This is an **index signature**. It means that `NormalizedBlockOutput` can have *any* additional properties with string keys, beyond those explicitly listed. This provides flexibility, allowing blocks to include custom, block-specific output data while still conforming to the overall standard.
    *   **`content?: string`**: Optional. Text content, commonly from Large Language Model (LLM) responses or text generation blocks.
    *   **`model?: string`**: Optional. The identifier of the model used, particularly relevant for LLM-based blocks.
    *   **`tokens?: { prompt?: number; completion?: number; total?: number; }`**: Optional. Details on token usage, also common for LLM interactions.
        *   `prompt`: Number of tokens in the input prompt.
        *   `completion`: Number of tokens generated in the response.
        *   `total`: Total tokens used.
    *   **`toolCalls?: { list: any[]; count: number; }`**: Optional. Information about any external tools that were invoked by the block (e.g., an AI agent calling a calculator tool).
        *   `list`: An array of details about each tool call.
        *   `count`: The total number of tool calls made.
    *   **`files?: UserFile[]`**: Optional. An array of `UserFile` objects representing any binary files or attachments produced by the block.
    *   **`selectedPath?: { blockId: string; blockType?: string; blockTitle?: string; }`**: Optional. Used by **routing blocks** (e.g., a "router" or "switch" block) to indicate which subsequent block was selected for execution.
        *   `blockId`: The ID of the chosen next block.
        *   `blockType`: Optional type of the selected block.
        *   `blockTitle`: Optional display title of the selected block.
    *   **`selectedConditionId?: string`**: Optional. Used by **conditional blocks** to specify which specific condition (branch) was met.
    *   **`conditionResult?: boolean`**: Optional. The boolean outcome of a conditional evaluation (e.g., `true` if a condition was met, `false` otherwise).
    *   **`result?: any`**: Optional. A generic field for any primary result value that doesn't fit into more specific fields.
    *   **`stdout?: string`**: Optional. Standard output (e.g., console logs) from blocks that execute code (like a Python or JavaScript function block).
    *   **`executionTime?: number`**: Optional. The time taken for this specific block to execute, in milliseconds.
    *   **`data?: any`**: Optional. The response body or data from API calls made by the block.
    *   **`status?: number`**: Optional. The HTTP status code from API calls (e.g., 200, 404, 500).
    *   **`headers?: Record<string, string>`**: Optional. HTTP response headers from API calls.
    *   **`error?: string`**: Optional. An error message if the block's execution failed.
    *   **`childTraceSpans?: TraceSpan[]`**: Optional. For workflow blocks that execute sub-workflows, this provides tracing information for those nested executions.
    *   **`childWorkflowName?: string`**: Optional. The name of the child workflow executed by a workflow block.

#### `BlockLog`

```typescript
export interface BlockLog {
  blockId: string
  blockName?: string
  blockType?: string
  startedAt: string
  endedAt: string
  durationMs: number
  success: boolean
  output?: any
  input?: any
  error?: string
}
```

*   **Purpose**: This interface defines a single entry in the execution log for a specific block. It's essential for debugging, auditing, and understanding the chronological flow and outcomes of a workflow run.
*   **Properties**:
    *   **`blockId`**: The unique identifier of the block that was executed.
    *   **`blockName?`**: Optional. The display name of the block.
    *   **`blockType?`**: Optional. The category or type of the block (e.g., "LLM", "API", "Router", "Agent").

    *   **`endedAt`**: An ISO timestamp indicating when the block's execution completed.
    *   **`durationMs`**: The total time taken for the block to execute, in milliseconds.
    *   **`success`**: A boolean indicating whether the block executed successfully (`true`) or failed (`false`).
    *   **`output?`**: Optional. The output data produced by the block upon successful execution. This is usually the `NormalizedBlockOutput` or a subset thereof.
    *   **`input?`**: Optional. The input data received by the block for its execution.
    *   **`error?`**: Optional. An error message if the block's execution failed.

#### `ExecutionMetadata`

```typescript
export interface ExecutionMetadata {
  startTime?: string
  endTime?: string
  duration: number
  pendingBlocks?: string[]
  isDebugSession?: boolean
  context?: ExecutionContext
  workflowConnections?: Array<{ source: string; target: string }>
}
```

*   **Purpose**: This interface captures high-level metadata about the *overall workflow execution*. It provides an overview of the entire run, distinct from the logs of individual blocks.
*   **Properties**:
    *   **`startTime?`**: Optional. An ISO timestamp when the entire workflow execution started.
    *   **`endTime?`**: Optional. An ISO timestamp when the entire workflow execution completed.
    *   **`duration`**: The total duration of the workflow execution, in milliseconds.
    *   **`pendingBlocks?`**: Optional. A list of block IDs that were still pending execution when the metadata was captured (useful for tracking incomplete runs or pauses).
    *   **`isDebugSession?`**: Optional. A boolean indicating if the workflow is currently running in a debug mode, which might alter behavior or logging levels.
    *   **`context?`**: Optional. A reference to the `ExecutionContext` object. This is a common pattern to link related data structures, providing a gateway to the detailed runtime context.
    *   **`workflowConnections?`**: Optional. An array representing the connections (edges) between blocks in the workflow graph. Each connection has a `source` block ID and a `target` block ID. Useful for visualizing the workflow graph or understanding paths.

#### `BlockState`

```typescript
export interface BlockState {
  output: NormalizedBlockOutput
  executed: boolean
  executionTime: number
}
```

*   **Purpose**: This interface captures the *current runtime state* of a single block *during* workflow execution. Unlike `BlockLog` which is a historical record, `BlockState` holds dynamic information relevant to the ongoing execution.
*   **Properties**:
    *   **`output`**: The current output data from the block, always conforming to `NormalizedBlockOutput`.
    *   **`executed`**: A boolean indicating whether this block has completed its execution at least once.
    *   **`executionTime`**: The time taken for the block's most recent execution, in milliseconds.

#### `ExecutionContext`

```typescript
export interface ExecutionContext {
  workflowId: string
  workspaceId?: string
  executionId?: string
  isDeployedContext?: boolean
  blockStates: Map<string, BlockState>
  blockLogs: BlockLog[]
  metadata: ExecutionMetadata
  environmentVariables: Record<string, string>
  workflowVariables?: Record<string, any>
  decisions: {
    router: Map<string, string>
    condition: Map<string, string>
  }
  loopIterations: Map<string, number>
  loopItems: Map<string, any>

  loopExecutions?: Map<string, { /* ... */ }>
  parallelBlockMapping?: Map<string, { /* ... */ }>
  currentVirtualBlockId?: string
  executedBlocks: Set<string>
  activeExecutionPath: Set<string>
  workflow?: SerializedWorkflow
  stream?: boolean
  selectedOutputs?: string[]
  edges?: Array<{ source: string; target: string }>
  onStream?: (streamingExecution: StreamingExecution) => Promise<string>
  onBlockComplete?: (blockId: string, output: any) => Promise<void>
}
```

*   **Purpose**: This is the most complex and central interface. It represents the **entire runtime environment and state** of a workflow instance. It's essentially the "brain" of the execution, passed around to blocks during execution, allowing them to access shared data, make routing decisions, track progress, and communicate with the system.
*   **Simplifying Complex Logic**: `ExecutionContext` consolidates all relevant information required to run a workflow: global IDs, block outputs, execution history, variables, control flow decisions (loops, parallel, routing), and even hooks for custom behavior. Instead of scattering this information, it's all in one place, making the execution logic more manageable.
*   **Properties**:
    *   **`workflowId`**: The unique identifier for this specific workflow execution instance.
    *   **`workspaceId?`**: Optional. An ID for the workspace, useful for scoping resources like file storage.
    *   **`executionId?`**: Optional. A unique ID for the current execution, often used for correlating logs or file storage.
    *   **`isDeployedContext?`**: Optional. A boolean indicating if this execution is running in a deployed environment (e.g., triggered by an API, webhook, or schedule), rather than a manual run in a builder UI.
    *   **`blockStates`**: A `Map` where keys are `blockId`s and values are `BlockState` objects. This tracks the current output and execution status of each block.
    *   **`blockLogs`**: An array of `BlockLog` entries, maintaining a chronological log of all block executions.
    *   **`metadata`**: An `ExecutionMetadata` object containing high-level information about the overall workflow run.
    *   **`environmentVariables`**: A `Record` (object) holding environment variables available during execution.
    *   **`workflowVariables?`**: Optional. A `Record` holding variables specific to this workflow instance, which blocks can read from or write to.
    *   **`decisions`**: An object containing `Map`s for tracking routing decisions:
        *   **`router`**: Maps `routerBlockId` to `targetBlockId`, indicating which path a router block chose.
        *   **`condition`**: Maps `conditionBlockId` to `selectedConditionId`, indicating which condition branch was taken.
    *   **`loopIterations`**: A `Map` tracking the current iteration count for each loop block.
    *   **`loopItems`**: A `Map` tracking the current item being processed in `forEach` loops or for parallel distribution.
    *   **`completedLoops`**: A `Set` of `blockId`s for loops that have finished all their iterations.
    *   **`parallelExecutions?`**: Optional. A `Map` tracking the state of parallel execution blocks. Each entry includes:
        *   `parallelCount`: Number of parallel branches.
        *   `distributionItems`: Items being distributed for parallel processing.
        *   `completedExecutions`: How many parallel branches have finished.
        *   `executionResults`: Results from each parallel branch.
        *   `activeIterations`: Currently running parallel iterations.
        *   `currentIteration`: Current iteration index.
        *   `parallelType`: 'count' (fixed number) or 'collection' (over items).
    *   **`loopExecutions?`**: Optional. Similar to parallel, but for sequential loop blocks (`for` or `forEach`). Tracks `maxIterations`, `loopType`, `forEachItems`, `executionResults`, and `currentIteration`.
    *   **`parallelBlockMapping?`**: Optional. A `Map` used to map "virtual" block IDs (created for parallel iterations) back to their `originalBlockId`, the `parallelId`, and the `iterationIndex`.
    *   **`currentVirtualBlockId?`**: Optional. The ID of the currently executing virtual block within a parallel iteration.
    *   **`executedBlocks`**: A `Set` of `blockId`s that have been executed.
    *   **`activeExecutionPath`**: A `Set` of `blockId`s representing the blocks in the current active execution path (useful for visualizing or debugging the flow).
    *   **`workflow?`**: Optional. A reference to the `SerializedWorkflow` object, providing the full definition of the workflow being executed.
    *   **`stream?`**: Optional. A boolean indicating whether the execution should attempt to stream responses if supported.

    *   **`onStream?`**: Optional. A callback function that can be provided to handle streaming data. It takes a `StreamingExecution` object and should return a Promise.
    *   **`onBlockComplete?`**: Optional. A callback function invoked when a block completes its execution. It receives the `blockId` and its `output`.

#### `ExecutionResult`

```typescript
export interface ExecutionResult {
  success: boolean
  output: NormalizedBlockOutput
  error?: string
  logs?: BlockLog[]
  metadata?: ExecutionMetadata
  _streamingMetadata?: {
    loggingSession: any
    processedInput: any
  }
}
```

*   **Purpose**: This interface defines the **complete outcome** of a finished workflow execution. It bundles all relevant information about the run's success, final output, and historical data.
*   **Properties**:
    *   **`success`**: A boolean indicating whether the entire workflow executed successfully (`true`) or encountered a failure (`false`).
    *   **`output`**: The final aggregated output data from the workflow, conforming to `NormalizedBlockOutput`. This might be the output of the last block, or a specifically designated output.
    *   **`error?`**: Optional. An error message if the workflow execution failed.
    *   **`logs?`**: Optional. An array of `BlockLog` entries, providing the full execution history.
    *   **`metadata?`**: Optional. The `ExecutionMetadata` for the workflow run.
    *   **`_streamingMetadata?`**: Optional. Internal metadata specifically for streaming executions. This is likely used by the system for its own bookkeeping related to how streaming was handled.

#### `StreamingExecution`

```typescript
export interface StreamingExecution {
  stream: ReadableStream
  execution: ExecutionResult & { isStreaming?: boolean }
}
```

*   **Purpose**: This interface is specifically designed for workflows that can produce output *asynchronously and incrementally* (streaming), rather than waiting for the entire workflow to finish before returning data. This is crucial for responsive user interfaces, especially with LLM or long-running tasks.
*   **Simplifying Complex Logic**: It combines a real-time data stream with the final execution result (which might be updated or finalized later). This allows consumers to start processing data immediately while still having access to the complete execution context and logs.
*   **Properties**:
    *   **`stream`**: A `ReadableStream` object. This is a Web API stream that allows consuming data chunks as they become available. The UI can read from this stream to display real-time updates.
    *   **`execution`**: The `ExecutionResult` object. This provides the full execution data (logs, metadata, final output) which might be populated progressively or finalized once the stream ends.
        *   **`isStreaming?`**: An optional boolean property added to `ExecutionResult` within this context, indicating that this particular `ExecutionResult` is associated with a stream.

#### `BlockExecutor`

```typescript
export interface BlockExecutor {
  canExecute(block: SerializedBlock): boolean
  execute(
    block: SerializedBlock,
    inputs: Record<string, any>,
    context: ExecutionContext
  ): Promise<BlockOutput>
}
```

*   **Purpose**: This interface defines a general contract for *any component capable of executing a block*. It acts as an abstraction, potentially for different execution environments or strategies (e.g., a local executor, a remote executor). An `BlockExecutor` might delegate to specific `BlockHandler`s.
*   **Methods**:
    *   **`canExecute(block: SerializedBlock): boolean`**: A method that determines if this executor is capable of processing the given `SerializedBlock` (i.e., if it knows how to run this type of block).
    *   **`execute(block: SerializedBlock, inputs: Record<string, any>, context: ExecutionContext): Promise<BlockOutput>`**: A method to execute the block.
        *   `block`: The `SerializedBlock` definition to execute.
        *   `inputs`: The resolved input parameters for the block.
        *   `context`: The current `ExecutionContext` for the workflow.
        *   Returns a `Promise` that resolves to the raw `BlockOutput` of the executed block.

#### `BlockHandler`

```typescript
export interface BlockHandler {
  canHandle(block: SerializedBlock): boolean
  execute(
    block: SerializedBlock,
    inputs: Record<string, any>,
    context: ExecutionContext
  ): Promise<BlockOutput | StreamingExecution>
}
```

*   **Purpose**: This interface defines a contract for components that are specifically responsible for **handling a particular type of block**. While `BlockExecutor` is a broader concept for *running* blocks, `BlockHandler` is typically where the actual logic for a specific block type (e.g., an LLM handler, an API handler, a code handler) resides. An `BlockExecutor` might orchestrate multiple `BlockHandler`s.
*   **Simplifying Complex Logic**: This separation of concerns allows the system to easily add new block types by implementing a new `BlockHandler` without modifying the core execution engine.
*   **Methods**:
    *   **`canHandle(block: SerializedBlock): boolean`**: Similar to `canExecute`, this method checks if this specific handler can process the given `SerializedBlock` (e.g., "I'm the LLM handler, can I handle a block of type 'llm-chat'?").
    *   **`execute(block: SerializedBlock, inputs: Record<string, any>, context: ExecutionContext): Promise<BlockOutput | StreamingExecution>`**: Executes the block.
        *   `block`: The `SerializedBlock` definition.
        *   `inputs`: The resolved input parameters.
        *   `context`: The current `ExecutionContext`.
        *   Returns a `Promise` that resolves to either a `BlockOutput` (raw output) or a `StreamingExecution` (if the block supports streaming). This distinction from `BlockExecutor` (which only returns `BlockOutput`) suggests that `BlockHandler` is closer to the actual block logic and can decide if streaming is possible.

#### `Tool`

```typescript
export interface Tool<P = any, O = Record<string, any>> {
  id: string
  name: string
  description: string
  version: string
  params: { /* ... */ }
  request?: { /* ... */ }
  transformResponse?: (response: any) => Promise<{ success: boolean; output: O; error?: string }>
}
```

*   **Purpose**: This interface defines the structure of an external "tool" that can be invoked by blocks (especially AI agent blocks). Tools represent specific capabilities like "search the web," "calculate a value," or "send an email." This makes the workflow extensible by connecting to external services or functionalities.
*   **Simplifying Complex Logic**: It provides a standardized way to describe a tool's capabilities (description, parameters) and how to interact with it (HTTP request config, response transformation).
*   **Type Parameters**:
    *   **`<P = any>`**: `P` represents the type of parameters the tool expects. Defaults to `any`.
    *   **`<O = Record<string, any>>`**: `O` represents the type of the output the tool produces. Defaults to a generic object.
*   **Properties**:
    *   **`id`**: A unique identifier for the tool.
    *   **`name`**: A human-readable name for the tool (e.g., "Web Search").
    *   **`description`**: A detailed explanation of what the tool does, often used by AI agents to decide when to call it.
    *   **`version`**: A version string for the tool.
    *   **`params`**: An object defining the input parameters the tool expects. Each parameter has:
        *   `type`: Data type (e.g., "string", "number", "boolean").
        *   `required?`: Whether the parameter is mandatory.
        *   `description?`: Description of the parameter.
        *   `default?`: Default value if not provided.
    *   **`request?`**: Optional. Configuration for making an HTTP request if the tool involves an API call:
        *   `url?`: The API endpoint URL, which can be a static string or a function that generates the URL based on input `params`.
        *   `method?`: The HTTP method (e.g., "GET", "POST").
        *   `headers?`: A function to generate HTTP request headers based on `params`.
        *   `body?`: A function to generate the HTTP request body based on `params`.
    *   **`transformResponse?`**: Optional. A function that takes the raw API response and transforms it into the tool's standardized output format (`O`), including success status and potential errors.

#### `ToolRegistry`

```typescript
export interface ToolRegistry {
  [key: string]: Tool
}
```

*   **Purpose**: This interface defines a simple registry (a lookup table) for all available tools, allowing them to be retrieved by their unique ID.
*   **Properties**:
    *   **`[key: string]: Tool`**: An index signature, meaning `ToolRegistry` is an object where each string key maps to a `Tool` object.

#### `ResponseFormatStreamProcessor`

```typescript
export interface ResponseFormatStreamProcessor {
  processStream(
    originalStream: ReadableStream,
    blockId: string,
    selectedOutputs: string[],
    responseFormat?: any
  ): ReadableStream
}
```

*   **Purpose**: This interface defines a contract for components that can process a raw `ReadableStream` and transform it based on a specified response format. This is useful when raw stream data needs to be parsed, filtered, or reformatted (e.g., converting a stream of JSON chunks into a stream of specific data objects) for the final consumer.
*   **Method**:
    *   **`processStream(originalStream: ReadableStream, blockId: string, selectedOutputs: string[], responseFormat?: any): ReadableStream`**: A method to take an `originalStream` and return a new, processed `ReadableStream`.
        *   `originalStream`: The initial stream of data.
        *   `blockId`: The ID of the block producing the stream.
        *   `selectedOutputs`: An array of block IDs representing outputs specifically requested.
        *   `responseFormat?`: Optional. Any specific format instructions (e.g., "json", "markdown") that guide how the stream should be processed.
