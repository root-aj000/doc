This file contains a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the `InputResolver` class in a TypeScript application. As a TypeScript expert and technical writer, I'll break down its purpose, complex logic, and each line of code.

### **Detailed Explanation of `InputResolver` Tests**

#### **1. Purpose of This File**

This test file (`InputResolver.test.ts`) is designed to rigorously verify the functionality of the `InputResolver` class. In a workflow execution system, blocks often need to consume values that are not hardcoded but rather come from other parts of the workflow. These values can be:

*   **Workflow Variables:** User-defined variables for the entire workflow.
*   **Outputs from Previous Blocks:** Results produced by blocks that have already executed.
*   **Environment Variables:** Configuration values injected into the execution environment.
*   **Loop/Parallel Context:** Special values available only when a block is inside a loop or parallel execution.
*   **Table Data:** References embedded within structured data like tables.
*   **2D Array Data:** Accessing specific elements within nested arrays.

The `InputResolver` class is responsible for taking a block's configuration, identifying these special references, and replacing them with their actual, resolved values based on the current execution context. This test file ensures that the `InputResolver` correctly handles all these scenarios, including various data types, interpolation, error conditions, and complex structural inputs, while also respecting connection-based access rules and dynamic UI conditions.

#### **2. Simplifying Complex Logic: The `InputResolver`'s Role**

Imagine a drag-and-drop workflow builder. When you configure a block, you might want its input to be the output of a previous block or a global variable. For example:

*   A "Send Email" block might need the recipient's email address, which comes from the "User Lookup" block's `email` output: `<User Lookup.email>`.
*   A "Function" block might need to use a workflow-level variable called `maxRetries`: `<variable.maxRetries>`.
*   An "API Call" block might need a secret API key from the environment: `{{API_KEY}}`.
*   If a block is inside a loop, it might need the current item being processed: `<loop.currentItem>`.

The `InputResolver` acts as a "translator" or "data mapper." Before a block actually executes, the `InputResolver` steps in, looks at all the block's input parameters, finds these special placeholders (e.g., `<...>`, `{{...}}`), fetches their real values from the `ExecutionContext` (which holds the current state of the workflow), and replaces the placeholders.

**Key Responsibilities Simplified:**

*   **Syntax Recognition:** It understands different syntaxes for references (e.g., `<block.output>`, `<variable.name>`, `{{ENV_VAR}}`, `<loop.index>`, `<parallel.currentItem>`, `<block.array[0][1]>`).
*   **Contextual Value Retrieval:** It pulls values from the `ExecutionContext`, which contains:
    *   `blockStates`: Outputs of all *executed* blocks.
    *   `workflow`: The overall workflow definition, including variables and block metadata.
    *   `environmentVariables`: Global environment configuration.
    *   `loopItems`, `loopIterations`: Current state of any active loops.
    *   `parallelExecutions`, `parallelBlockMapping`, `currentVirtualBlockId`: Current state of any active parallel executions.
*   **Data Type Conversion:** It attempts to convert resolved string values (e.g., `"42"`, `"true"`, `"{...}"`) into their correct JavaScript types (number, boolean, object/array) if the target input type is specified (e.g., `number`, `boolean`, `json`).
*   **Interpolation:** It handles cases where references are embedded within a larger string (e.g., `"Hello <variable.stringVar>!"`).
*   **Accessibility Control:** Crucially, it uses an `accessibleBlocksMap` to ensure that a block can *only* reference data from blocks it's logically connected to (or the starter block), preventing unauthorized or impossible data access.
*   **Conditional Inputs:** It checks a block's UI configuration to determine which input fields are currently "visible" and active based on other input values (e.g., if you select "Search" in a dropdown, only the "query" field appears). It only resolves inputs that meet these conditions.
*   **Virtual Block Handling (Parallel):** When blocks run in parallel, multiple *virtual* instances of a block can exist. The resolver understands how to target the correct virtual block's output for references within that specific parallel iteration.

In essence, the `InputResolver` makes dynamic, data-driven workflows possible by intelligently processing and injecting the right values at the right time.

#### **3. Explanation Line by Line**

```typescript
import { afterEach, beforeEach, describe, expect, it, vi } from 'vitest'
```

*   **`import ... from 'vitest'`**: Imports testing utilities from `vitest`, a fast unit testing framework.
    *   `describe`: Groups related tests together.
    *   `it`: Defines an individual test case (often called `test`).
    *   `expect`: Used for making assertions about values.
    *   `beforeEach`: Runs a function before each test in the `describe` block.
    *   `afterEach`: Runs a function after each test in the `describe` block.
    *   `vi`: Vitest's mocking utility, similar to Jest's `jest`.

```typescript
import { getBlock } from '@/blocks/index'
import { BlockType } from '@/executor/consts'
import { InputResolver } from '@/executor/resolver/resolver'
import type { ExecutionContext } from '@/executor/types'
import type { SerializedBlock, SerializedWorkflow } from '@/serializer/types'
```

*   **`import { getBlock } from '@/blocks/index'`**: Imports a helper function `getBlock`. This function is likely used to retrieve the *definition* or schema of a block type, which might include information about its input fields and their conditions. It's mocked later to control test behavior.
*   **`import { BlockType } from '@/executor/consts'`**: Imports an enum or object `BlockType` containing constants for various block identifiers (e.g., `STARTER`, `FUNCTION`, `API`).
*   **`import { InputResolver } from '@/executor/resolver/resolver'`**: This is the class under test.
*   **`import type { ExecutionContext } from '@/executor/types'`**: Imports the TypeScript type definition for `ExecutionContext`. This object holds the runtime state of the workflow during execution.
*   **`import type { SerializedBlock, SerializedWorkflow } from '@/serializer/types'`**: Imports type definitions for `SerializedBlock` (how an individual block is stored) and `SerializedWorkflow` (how the entire workflow, including blocks, connections, and loops, is stored).

---

```typescript
describe('InputResolver', () => {
  let sampleWorkflow: SerializedWorkflow
  let mockContext: any
  let mockEnvironmentVars: Record<string, string>
  let mockWorkflowVars: Record<string, any>
  let resolver: InputResolver
```

*   **`describe('InputResolver', () => { ... })`**: Defines the main test suite for the `InputResolver` class.
*   **`let sampleWorkflow: SerializedWorkflow`**: Declares a variable to hold a mock workflow structure.
*   **`let mockContext: any`**: Declares a variable for a mock `ExecutionContext`. It's `any` for flexibility in tests, but in a real scenario, it would strictly adhere to `ExecutionContext` type.
*   **`let mockEnvironmentVars: Record<string, string>`**: Declares a variable for mock environment variables (key-value strings).
*   **`let mockWorkflowVars: Record<string, any>`**: Declares a variable for mock workflow-level variables. `any` because variable values can be of various types.
*   **`let resolver: InputResolver`**: Declares the instance of the `InputResolver` class that will be tested.

```typescript
  beforeEach(() => {
    sampleWorkflow = {
      version: '1.0',
      blocks: [
        {
          id: 'starter-block',
          metadata: { id: BlockType.STARTER, name: 'Start' },
          position: { x: 100, y: 100 },
          config: { tool: BlockType.STARTER, params: {} },
          inputs: {},
          outputs: {},
          enabled: true,
        },
        // ... other block definitions ...
        {
          id: 'disabled-block',
          metadata: { id: 'generic', name: 'Disabled Block' },
          position: { x: 900, y: 100 },
          config: { tool: 'generic', params: {} },
          inputs: {},
          outputs: {},
          enabled: false, // This block is explicitly disabled
        },
      ],
      connections: [
        { source: 'starter-block', target: 'function-block' },
        { source: 'function-block', target: 'condition-block' },
        { source: 'condition-block', target: 'api-block' },
        { source: 'api-block', target: 'disabled-block' },
      ],
      loops: {},
    }
```

*   **`beforeEach(() => { ... })`**: This block runs before *each* test defined in this `describe` suite. It sets up a fresh state for each test, ensuring isolation.
*   **`sampleWorkflow = { ... }`**: Initializes `sampleWorkflow` with a `SerializedWorkflow` object.
    *   `version: '1.0'`: Workflow schema version.
    *   `blocks`: An array of `SerializedBlock` objects. Each block has:
        *   `id`: Unique identifier (e.g., `'starter-block'`).
        *   `metadata`: `id` (block type constant) and `name` (user-friendly name).
        *   `position`: For UI rendering.
        *   `config`: `tool` (same as metadata `id`) and `params` (the actual inputs to be resolved).
        *   `inputs`, `outputs`: Define the block's expected input/output schema.
        *   `enabled`: A flag indicating if the block is active. `disabled-block` is `false`.
    *   `connections`: Defines the flow of control between blocks using `source` and `target` block IDs.
    *   `loops`: An empty object, indicating no loops in this base workflow. (Later tests will add loops).

```typescript
    mockContext = {
      workflowId: 'test-workflow',
      workflow: sampleWorkflow,
      blockStates: new Map([
        [
          'starter-block',
          { output: { input: 'Hello World', type: 'text' }, executed: true, executionTime: 0 },
        ],
        ['function-block', { output: { result: '42' }, executed: true, executionTime: 0 }], // String value as it would be in real app
      ]),
      activeExecutionPath: new Set(['starter-block', 'function-block']),
      blockLogs: [],
      metadata: { duration: 0 },
      environmentVariables: {},
      decisions: { router: new Map(), condition: new Map() },
      loopIterations: new Map(),
      loopItems: new Map(),
      completedLoops: new Set(),
      executedBlocks: new Set(['starter-block', 'function-block']),
    }
```

*   **`mockContext = { ... }`**: Initializes `mockContext` to simulate the `ExecutionContext` at a specific point during workflow execution.
    *   `workflowId`: Identifier for the running workflow.
    *   `workflow`: A reference to the `sampleWorkflow` defined above.
    *   `blockStates`: A `Map` storing the *outputs* of blocks that have already executed. This is crucial for resolving block references (e.g., `<starter-block.input>`).
        *   `starter-block` produced `{ input: 'Hello World', type: 'text' }`.
        *   `function-block` produced `{ result: '42' }` (note: `42` is a string here, testing type conversion).
    *   `activeExecutionPath`: A `Set` of block IDs that are currently considered part of the active path. Used for validation, ensuring references are made only to blocks that were logically executed *before* the current block.
    *   `environmentVariables`, `decisions`, `loopIterations`, `loopItems`, `completedLoops`, `executedBlocks`, `blockLogs`, `metadata`: Other properties of the `ExecutionContext`, mostly empty or default for this base setup, but important for specific tests later.

```typescript
    mockEnvironmentVars = {
      API_KEY: 'test-api-key',
      BASE_URL: 'https://api.example.com',
    }

    mockWorkflowVars = {
      stringVar: {
        id: 'var1',
        workflowId: 'test-workflow',
        name: 'stringVar',
        type: 'string',
        value: 'Hello',
      },
      // ... other workflow variable definitions ...
      plainVar: {
        id: 'var6',
        workflowId: 'test-workflow',
        name: 'plainVar',
        type: 'plain',
        value: 'Raw text without quotes',
      },
    }
```

*   **`mockEnvironmentVars = { ... }`**: Defines a set of mock environment variables that the `InputResolver` might need to look up.
*   **`mockWorkflowVars = { ... }`**: Defines mock workflow-level variables with different types (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, `object`, `array`, `plain`). The `value` for non-string types is typically stored as a string and needs parsing by the resolver. `plain` indicates a raw string value that shouldn't be quoted when injected into code.

```typescript
    const accessibleBlocksMap = new Map<string, Set<string>>()
    const allBlockIds = sampleWorkflow.blocks.map((b) => b.id)
    const testBlockIds = ['test-block', 'test-block-2', 'generic-block']
    const allIds = [...allBlockIds, ...testBlockIds]

    sampleWorkflow.blocks.forEach((block) => {
      const accessibleBlocks = new Set(allIds)
      accessibleBlocksMap.set(block.id, accessibleBlocks)
    })

    testBlockIds.forEach((testId) => {
      const accessibleBlocks = new Set(allIds)
      accessibleBlocksMap.set(testId, accessibleBlocks)
    })
```

*   **`const accessibleBlocksMap = new Map<string, Set<string>>()`**: This `Map` is critical for validating block references. It defines, for *each* block ID, a `Set` of other block IDs that are considered "accessible" (i.e., whose outputs can be referenced). This simulates connection-based data flow restrictions.
*   **`const allBlockIds = sampleWorkflow.blocks.map((b) => b.id)`**: Gets all IDs from the `sampleWorkflow`.
*   **`const testBlockIds = ['test-block', 'test-block-2', 'generic-block']`**: Defines IDs for blocks that will be created *within* specific `it` tests (not part of `sampleWorkflow` initially).
*   **`const allIds = [...allBlockIds, ...testBlockIds]`**: Combines all known block IDs.
*   **`sampleWorkflow.blocks.forEach(...)` and `testBlockIds.forEach(...)`**: Loops through all block IDs and, for each block, populates `accessibleBlocksMap`. In this `beforeEach` setup, for simplicity, *every* block is made accessible from *every other* block. More granular and realistic accessibility rules are applied in later `describe` blocks, especially `Connection-Based Reference Validation`.

```typescript
    resolver = new InputResolver(
      sampleWorkflow,
      mockEnvironmentVars,
      mockWorkflowVars,
      undefined, // blockLoopMapping - not used in base setup
      accessibleBlocksMap
    )
  })
```

*   **`resolver = new InputResolver(...)`**: Instantiates the `InputResolver` with the mock data:
    *   `sampleWorkflow`: The overall workflow structure.
    *   `mockEnvironmentVars`: The environment variables.
    *   `mockWorkflowVars`: The workflow-level variables.
    *   `undefined`: The `blockLoopMapping` parameter is not relevant for the base setup, so it's `undefined`.
    *   `accessibleBlocksMap`: The map defining which blocks can reference each other.

---

```typescript
  afterEach(() => {
    vi.clearAllMocks()
  })
```

*   **`afterEach(() => { ... })`**: This hook runs after each test.
*   **`vi.clearAllMocks()`**: Cleans up any mocks created using `vi` (Vitest's mocking utility). This ensures that mocks from one test don't interfere with subsequent tests.

---

#### **4. Test Suites ( `describe` blocks )**

Now, let's dive into the individual test suites, each focusing on a different aspect of the `InputResolver`.

##### **`describe('Variable Value Resolution', () => { ... })`**

This suite tests how the `InputResolver` handles references to workflow variables, converting them to their correct types and handling interpolation.

*   **`it('should resolve string variables correctly', () => { ... })`**:
    *   Creates a `test-block` with `params` that reference `stringVar` directly (`<variable.stringVar>`) and interpolated (`Hello <variable.stringVar>!`).
    *   `inputs` defines the expected data type for `directRef` as `'string'`.
    *   `resolver.resolveInputs(block, mockContext)`: Calls the method under test.
    *   `expect(result.directRef).toBe('Hello')`: Asserts the direct reference is resolved to the raw string value.
    *   `expect(result.interpolated).toBe('Hello Hello!')`: Asserts the interpolated string correctly substitutes the variable.

*   **`it('should resolve number variables correctly', () => { ... })`**: Similar to the string test, but for `numberVar`. The `directRef` `inputs` type is `'number'`, so the string `"42"` is converted to the number `42`. The interpolated version remains a string.

*   **`it('should resolve boolean variables correctly', () => { ... })`**: Similar to number/string, but for `boolVar`. The `directRef` `inputs` type is `'boolean'`, so `"true"` becomes `true`.

*   **`it('should resolve object variables correctly', () => { ... })`**: Tests `objectVar`. The `inputs` type is `'json'`, so the string `'{"name":"John","age":30}'` is parsed into a JavaScript object.

*   **`it('should resolve plain text variables without quoting', () => { ... })`**: Tests `plainVar`. `plain` variables are expected to be injected as raw text, without additional quotes, useful for certain code or script injections where the value itself shouldn't be stringified.

---

##### **`describe('Block Reference Resolution', () => { ... })`**

This suite focuses on resolving references to outputs from other blocks, including special aliases and error conditions.

*   **`it('should resolve references to other blocks', () => { ... })`**:
    *   The `test-block` references `starter-block.input`, `function-block.result`, and `Start.input` (using the block's `name`).
    *   The test asserts that these are resolved to `Hello World` and `42` respectively, demonstrating resolution by both ID and name.

*   **`it('should handle the special "start" alias for starter block', () => { ... })`**:
    *   Tests the special alias `<start.input>` and `<start.type>`, which is a common shorthand for the starter block's output.

*   **`it('should throw an error for references to inactive blocks', () => { ... })`**:
    *   Creates a reference to `condition-block.result`.
    *   The `mockContext.activeExecutionPath` intentionally *does not* include `condition-block`, simulating an inactive block (one that hasn't been executed or isn't on the current path).
    *   `expect(result.inactiveRef).toBe('')`: Asserts that references to inactive blocks resolve to an empty string. *Correction from original thought: the test code expects an empty string, not an error.*

*   **`it('should throw an error for references to disabled blocks', () => { ... })`**:
    *   Modifies `sampleWorkflow` to connect `disabled-block` (which has `enabled: false`) to the `test-block`.
    *   Adds `disabled-block` to `mockContext.activeExecutionPath` to indicate it *would* have been considered active if enabled.
    *   The test expects `resolver.resolveInputs` to `toThrow(/Block ".+" is disabled/)` because the `disabled-block`'s `enabled` flag is `false`.

---

##### **`describe('Environment Variable Resolution', () => { ... })`**

This suite tests how `InputResolver` resolves references to environment variables using the `{{VAR_NAME}}` syntax.

*   **`it('should resolve environment variables in API key contexts', () => { ... })`**:
    *   Shows `{{API_KEY}}` being resolved within `apiKey` and `url` parameters.
    *   Also tests `{{BASE_URL}}` in a `regularParam`.
    *   Asserts correct substitution with values from `mockEnvironmentVars`.

*   **`it('should resolve explicit environment variables', () => { ... })`**: A simpler test verifying direct resolution of a single environment variable.

*   **`it('should resolve environment variables in all contexts', () => { ... })`**: Demonstrates that environment variable interpolation works even when embedded within other strings.

---

##### **`describe('Table Cell Resolution', () => { ... })`**

This suite verifies that the `InputResolver` can correctly resolve references embedded within complex, nested data structures, specifically an array of objects representing a table.

*   **`it('should resolve variable references in table cells', () => { ... })`**:
    *   The `tableParam` in `config.params` is an array of objects, where each `cells.Value` contains a variable reference.
    *   The test asserts that `stringVar`, `numberVar`, and `plainVar` are correctly resolved within these nested structures, including type conversion for `numberVar`.

*   **`it('should resolve block references in table cells', () => { ... })`**: Similar to the above, but demonstrating resolution of block outputs (`<start.input>`, `<function-block.result>`) inside table cells.

*   **`it('should handle interpolated variable references in table cells', () => { ... })`**: Shows that interpolation also works within table cell values.

---

##### **`describe('Special Block Types', () => { ... })`**

This suite covers specific handling or formatting requirements for inputs of particular block types.

*   **`it('should handle code input for function blocks', () => { ... })`**:
    *   For a `FUNCTION` block, the `code` parameter often contains executable JavaScript.
    *   References inside this code (`<variable.stringVar>`, `<variable.numberVar>`) should be resolved.
    *   Crucially, `stringVar` is enclosed in quotes (`"Hello"`) to make it a valid JavaScript string, while `numberVar` is injected as a raw number (`42`). This demonstrates intelligent formatting based on context.

*   **`it('should handle body input for API blocks', () => { ... })`**:
    *   For an `API` block, the `body` parameter often expects a JSON string.
    *   References within this JSON string are resolved, and the final output is parsed as a JavaScript object, not just a string. This shows type awareness for `json` inputs.

*   **`it('should handle conditions parameter for condition blocks', () => { ... })`**:
    *   For `CONDITION` blocks, the `conditions` parameter is typically a JavaScript expression that the executor evaluates.
    *   The `InputResolver` usually *does not* resolve references directly within `conditions` at this stage, as the `CONDITION` block itself handles the evaluation later.
    *   The test expects the reference `<start.input>` to remain as-is in the `conditions` string.

---

##### **`describe('findVariableByName Helper', () => { ... })`**

This is a simpler, more focused test confirming that the underlying logic for finding workflow variables by name works correctly.

*   **`it('should find variables with exact name match', () => { ... })`**: Confirms that direct variable references resolve to their correct values.

---

##### **`describe('direct loop references', () => { ... })`**

This suite tests the resolution of special variables available when a block is executing within a loop.

*   **`it('should resolve direct loop.currentItem reference without quotes', () => { ... })`**:
    *   Sets up a `workflow` with a `LOOP` block and a `functionBlock` inside it.
    *   `context.loopIterations` and `context.loopItems` are mocked to simulate an active loop iteration.
    *   `expect(resolvedInputs.item).toEqual(['item1'])`: Asserts that `<loop.currentItem>` resolves to the current item being processed in the loop. The `toEqual` implies it might be an array of items (or a single item that's an array).

*   **`it('should resolve direct loop.index reference without quotes', () => { ... })`**:
    *   Similar setup, but for `<loop.index>`.
    *   `context.loopIterations` is set to `3` (for the 3rd iteration), which translates to a 0-based index of `2`.

*   **`it('should resolve direct loop.items reference for forEach loops', () => { ... })`**:
    *   Tests `<loop.items>`, which should resolve to the entire array of items being iterated over in a `forEach` loop.
    *   The `loopItemsMap` stores a key `loop-1_items` with the full array.

*   **`it('should handle missing loop-1_items gracefully', () => { ... })`**:
    *   Tests a scenario where `loopItemsMap` *doesn't* have `loop-1_items`.
    *   In this case, the resolver should fall back to the `forEachItems` defined directly in the `loop` configuration of the `workflow`.

---

##### **`describe('parallel references', () => { ... })`**

This suite tests the resolution of special variables and block outputs within the context of parallel workflow execution. Parallel executions create "virtual" instances of blocks.

*   **`it('should resolve parallel references when block is inside a parallel', () => { ... })`**:
    *   Sets up a `workflow` with a `PARALLEL` block and a `function-1` inside it.
    *   `context.loopItems` is misleadingly named here (it seems to be reused for parallel `currentItem` in the mock), set to `['test-item']`.
    *   `expect(result.code).toEqual(['test-item'])`: Asserts that `<parallel.currentItem>` resolves to the current item being processed by the parallel instance.

*   **`it('should resolve parallel references by block name when multiple parallels exist', () => { ... })`**:
    *   Creates a workflow with `Parallel 1` and `Parallel 2`.
    *   A `function-1` block references `<Parallel1.results>`.
    *   The `blockStates` are mocked for the *original* parallel blocks, containing `results` arrays.
    *   The `accessibleBlocksMap` is set up to allow `function-1` to see both parallel blocks.
    *   `expect(result.code).toBe('["result1","result2"]')`: Asserts that referring to a parallel block by its *name* (e.g., `Parallel1`) resolves to its overall results. Note the stringified JSON output for `code` param.

*   **`it('should resolve parallel references by block ID when needed', () => { ... })`**:
    *   Similar to the above, but referencing `parallel-1.results` by its ID.
    *   Expects the same behavior, showing flexibility in referencing.

---

##### **`describe('Connection-Based Reference Validation', () => { ... })`**

This is a very important suite that ensures the `InputResolver` respects the logical connections between blocks, preventing a block from accessing data from any arbitrary block in the workflow.

*   **`let workflowWithConnections: SerializedWorkflow`, `let connectionResolver: InputResolver`, `let contextWithConnections: ExecutionContext`**: Declares variables specific to this suite's setup.
*   **`beforeEach(() => { ... })`**: This `beforeEach` has a custom setup for `workflowWithConnections` and `accessibleBlocksMap`.
    *   **Custom `accessibleBlocksMap` Logic**: Instead of making all blocks accessible to each other, this setup explicitly populates `accessibleBlocksMap` based on:
        *   **Direct Connections**: If a block `A` connects to `B`, then `B` can access `A`'s output.
        *   **Starter Block**: The starter block's output is *always* accessible to any block.
        *   Test blocks (`test-block`, `test-response-block`) are also explicitly set up with connections. This simulates a more realistic scenario where `InputResolver` relies on a pre-calculated map of accessible blocks.

*   **`it('should allow references to directly connected blocks', () => { ... })`**:
    *   `function-1` is connected to `agent-1`.
    *   The `testBlock` (which is a modified `function-1`) references `<agent-1.content>`.
    *   Expects successful resolution, demonstrating direct connection allows access.

*   **`it('should leave references to unconnected blocks as strings', () => { ... })`**:
    *   A `test-block` is connected to `agent-1` but *not* `isolated-block`.
    *   The `test-block` attempts to reference `<isolated-block.content>`.
    *   Expects the reference to remain as a literal string `"<isolated-block.content>"` because `isolated-block` is not accessible to `test-block` via connections. The resolver should not try to resolve it.

*   **`it('should always allow references to starter block', () => { ... })`**:
    *   Demonstrates that any block can reference `<start.input>` regardless of direct connections, as the starter block is globally accessible.

*   **`it('should format start.input properly for different block types', () => { ... })`**:
    *   Shows how `start.input` is formatted differently when resolved into different block types:
        *   `FUNCTION` block's `code` parameter: `return "Hello World"` (quoted for valid JS string).
        *   `CONDITION` block's `conditions`: `"<start.input> === \\"Hello World\\""` (resolved value in the string *after* `JSON.stringify`, but the `conditions` expression itself isn't directly evaluated by `InputResolver` at this stage, so it remains as a reference).
        *   `RESPONSE` block's `content`: `Hello World` (raw string, as response content is often plain text).

*   **`it('should properly format start.input when resolved directly via resolveBlockReferences', () => { ... })`**:
    *   Tests the internal `resolveBlockReferences` method directly to ensure the formatting logic (quoting for Function/Condition blocks, raw for others) is correct.

*   **`it('should not throw for unconnected blocks and leave references as strings', () => { ... })`**:
    *   Similar to an earlier test, this confirms that references to blocks that are simply *nonexistent* (`<nonexistent.value>`) or inaccessible also remain as literal strings, rather than causing an error.

*   **`it('should work with block names and normalized names', () => { ... })`**:
    *   Confirms that block references can use the actual block name (`<Agent Block.content>`), a "normalized" version of the name (`<agentblock.content>`), or the block ID (`<agent-1.content>`), all resolving correctly.

*   **`it('should handle complex connection graphs', () => { ... })`**:
    *   Tests a more complex scenario with an `extendedWorkflow` and specific `accessibleBlocksMap` rules.
    *   `response-1` is connected to `function-1` but *not* `agent-1`.
    *   Expects `<function-1.result>` to resolve (direct connection) but `<agent-1.content>` to remain a string (indirect connection).

*   **`it('should handle blocks in same loop referencing each other', () => { ... })`**:
    *   Sets up a `loopWorkflow` where `function-1` and `function-2` are both *within the same loop*.
    *   The `loopAccessibilityMap` explicitly allows blocks within the same loop to reference each other.
    *   Ensures `function-1` can reference `function-2.result` without an issue, even if they aren't directly connected in the main workflow graph (the loop context provides this implicit connection).

##### **`describe('Conditional Input Filtering', () => { ... })`**

This suite tests a more advanced feature: dynamically filtering input parameters based on conditions defined in the block's UI configuration. This mimics a UI where selecting an option in one dropdown shows/hides other input fields.

*   **`const mockGetBlock = getBlock as ReturnType<typeof vi.fn>`**: Casts the `getBlock` import to a mockable function.
*   **`afterEach(() => { mockGetBlock.mockReset() })`**: Cleans up `getBlock` mock after each test.
*   **`it('should filter inputs based on operation conditions for Knowledge block', () => { ... })`**:
    *   `mockGetBlock.mockReturnValue(...)`: Mocks the `getBlock` function to return a specific configuration for a `'knowledge'` block. This configuration includes `subBlocks` with `condition` properties (e.g., `condition: { field: 'operation', value: 'search' }`).
    *   Creates a `knowledgeBlock` with `operation: 'upload_chunk'`.
    *   When `resolveInputs` is called, it checks the block's `params.operation` value against the `condition` of each sub-block.
    *   `expect(result).toHaveProperty('documentId', 'doc-1')` and `expect(result).not.toHaveProperty('query')`: Asserts that only inputs relevant to `'upload_chunk'` are included in the resolved output.

*   **`it('should filter inputs based on operation conditions for Knowledge block search operation', () => { ... })`**: Similar to the above, but tests the `search` operation, ensuring `query` and `knowledgeBaseIds` are included, and `documentId`/`content` are filtered out.

*   **`it('should handle array conditions correctly', () => { ... })`**:
    *   Tests a condition where `value` is an array (`value: ['create', 'update']`).
    *   If `operation` is `'update'`, both `data` and `id` fields should be included.

*   **`it('should include all inputs when no conditions are present', () => { ... })`**: Verifies that if a `subBlock` has no `condition`, its input is always included.

*   **`it('should return all inputs when block config is not found', () => { ... })`**: If `getBlock` returns `undefined` (meaning no UI configuration for that block type), the resolver should simply return all parameters provided in `block.config.params`, as it cannot apply any filtering.

*   **`it('should handle negated conditions correctly', () => { ... })`**:
    *   Tests `condition: { field: 'operation', value: 'create', not: true }`.
    *   If `operation` is `'delete'`, the condition (`operation !== 'create'`) is true, so `confirmationField` should be included.

*   **`it('should handle compound AND conditions correctly', () => { ... })`**:
    *   Tests `condition: { field: 'operation', value: 'update', and: { field: 'enabled', value: true } }`.
    *   Both conditions must be true for `specialField` to be included.

*   **`it('should always include inputs without conditions', () => { ... })`**: Further tests that `params` without conditions are always passed through.

*   **`it('should handle duplicate field names with different conditions (Knowledge block case)', () => { ... })`**:
    *   Simulates a `knowledge` block where the `content` field appears twice with different conditions.
    *   Ensures that only the `content` field whose condition matches the `operation` is included in the resolved inputs.

##### **`describe('2D Array Indexing', () => { ... })`**

This suite tests the ability to access specific elements within nested arrays using multiple square brackets, like `array[0][1]`.

*   **`let arrayResolver: InputResolver`, `let arrayContext: any`**: Variables for this suite.
*   **`beforeEach(() => { ... })`**:
    *   Extends `sampleWorkflow` with new blocks.
    *   `arrayContext` extends `mockContext` and adds `blockStates` for `array-block` (containing 2D and 3D arrays), `non-array-block`, and `single-array-block`.
    *   The `accessibleBlocksMap` is also extended.
    *   `arrayResolver` is instantiated.

*   **`it.concurrent('should resolve basic 2D array access like matrix[0][1]', () => { ... })`**: Tests retrieving `b` from `matrix[0][1]`.
*   **`it.concurrent('should resolve 2D array access with different indices', () => { ... })`**: Tests various 2D array accesses.
*   **`it.concurrent('should resolve property access combined with 2D array indexing', () => { ... })`**: Tests `nestedData.values[0][1]`, combining property access and 2D indexing.
*   **`it.concurrent('should resolve 3D array access (multiple nested indices)', () => { ... })`**: Tests `deepNested[0][0][1]`, extending to three dimensions.
*   **`it.concurrent('should handle start block with 2D array access', () => { ... })`**: Sets `starter-block` output to include 2D array data and resolves references to it.
*   **`it.concurrent('should throw error for out of bounds 2D array access', () => { ... })`**: Expects an error when `matrix[5][1]` is accessed (row 5 doesn't exist).
*   **`it.concurrent('should throw error for out of bounds second dimension access', () => { ... })`**: Expects an error when `matrix[1][5]` is accessed (column 5 doesn't exist).
*   **`it.concurrent('should throw error when accessing non-array as array', () => { ... })`**: Expects an error when attempting `notAnArray[0][1]` on a string.
*   **`it.concurrent('should throw error with invalid index format', () => { ... })`**: Expects an error for non-numeric indices like `matrix[0][abc]`.
*   **`it.concurrent('should maintain backward compatibility with single array indexing', () => { ... })`**: Confirms that 1D array access (`items[0]`) still works.
*   **`it.concurrent('should handle mixed single and multi-dimensional access in same block', () => { ... })`**: Shows that `matrix[1]` (whole row) and `matrix[1][1]` (specific element) can be accessed concurrently.
*   **`it.concurrent('should properly format 2D array values for different block types', () => { ... })`**: Similar to `start.input` formatting, ensures 2D array elements are quoted appropriately for `FUNCTION` and `CONDITION` blocks.

---

##### **`describe('Variable Reference Validation', () => { ... })`**

This suite clarifies what patterns are considered valid references and which are treated as literal strings, especially distinguishing references from logical/arithmetic expressions.

*   **`it.concurrent('should allow block references without dots like <start>', () => { ... })`**:
    *   Tests a reference like `<start>` (without `.input` or other properties).
    *   This implies the resolver should be smart enough to inject the *entire output* of the starter block in this case, or a default property. The `expect(result.content).not.toBe('Value from <start> block')` indicates it *is* resolved.

*   **`it.concurrent('should allow other block references without dots', () => { ... })`**:
    *   Similar to `<start>`, allows `<testblock>` (without a dot) to refer to the entire output of another block named `testblock`.

*   **`it.concurrent('should reject operator expressions that look like comparisons', () => { ... })`**:
    *   Tests that expressions like `x < 5 && 8 > b` within a `conditions` parameter are *not* resolved by the `InputResolver` but remain as literal strings, as they are meant for a separate expression evaluator.

*   **`it.concurrent('should still allow regular dotted references', () => { ... })`**: Confirms that standard dotted references like `<start.input>` continue to work as expected.

*   **`it.concurrent('should handle complex expressions with both valid references and operators', () => { ... })`**: Shows a mix of valid block references and logical operators. The block references should *not* be resolved by the `InputResolver` in this `conditions` context (as confirmed earlier for `CONDITION` block inputs).

*   **`it.concurrent('should reject numeric patterns that look like arithmetic', () => { ... })`**: Confirms that arithmetic expressions like `10 + 5` are treated as literal strings and not mistakenly resolved as references.

---

##### **`describe('Virtual Block Reference Resolution (Parallel Execution)', () => { ... })`**

This advanced suite tests how the resolver handles blocks executing in parallel. In a parallel execution, a single "logical" block might have multiple "virtual" instances running concurrently. The resolver needs to know which specific instance's output to use when resolving references.

*   **`let parallelWorkflow: SerializedWorkflow`, `let parallelContext: ExecutionContext`, `let resolver: InputResolver`**: Variables for this suite.
*   **`beforeEach(() => { ... })`**:
    *   Sets up `parallelWorkflow` with `PARALLEL` and nested `FUNCTION` blocks.
    *   `parallelContext`: Crucially, `blockStates` now contains entries like `function1-block_parallel_parallel-block_iteration_0`. These are the *virtual block IDs*.
    *   `parallelContext.parallelBlockMapping`: Maps these virtual IDs back to their original block, parallel block, and iteration index.
    *   `parallelContext.currentVirtualBlockId`: This property on the context tells the resolver *which specific virtual block instance* is currently requesting input resolution.

*   **`it('should resolve references to blocks within same parallel iteration', () => { ... })`**:
    *   Sets `currentVirtualBlockId` to `iteration_0`.
    *   The `function2-block` references `<function1.result>`.
    *   The resolver should correctly find `function1-block_parallel_parallel-block_iteration_0`'s output (`0`) rather than the original `function1-block`'s output (`should-not-use-this`).

*   **`it('should resolve references correctly for different iterations', () => { ... })`**: Repeats the above for `iteration_1` and `iteration_2`, confirming that the correct virtual block's output is used for each.

*   **`it('should fall back to regular resolution for blocks outside parallel', () => { ... })`**:
    *   If a reference is made to a block *outside* the current parallel execution (like `start-block`), the resolver should use the standard `blockStates` (non-virtual ID) for that block.

*   **`it('should handle missing virtual block mapping gracefully', () => { ... })`**: If `parallelBlockMapping` is empty, the resolver can't find the virtual block details and falls back to the original block's state.

*   **`it('should handle missing virtual block state gracefully', () => { ... })`**: If a virtual block mapping exists, but the corresponding `blockState` for that virtual ID is missing, an error is expected (as the data should exist if the block executed).

*   **`it('should not use virtual resolution when not in parallel execution', () => { ... })`**: If `currentVirtualBlockId` is not set, the resolver should behave as if it's a normal, non-parallel execution, using the regular block IDs.

*   **`it('should handle complex references within parallel iterations', () => { ... })`**: Tests a block (`function3-block`) referencing two *other* blocks (`function1`, `function2`) that are *also* part of the same parallel execution. Ensures all references correctly resolve to their respective virtual block outputs for the current iteration.

*   **`it('should validate that source block is in same parallel before using virtual resolution', () => { ... })`**:
    *   Crucially, this tests a safety mechanism. If `function1-block` is *not* listed as a node in the `parallel-block` definition, then `function2-block` should *not* try to resolve `<function1.result>` using virtual block IDs, even if a virtual `function1` state exists. It should fall back to the non-virtual `function1` state, ensuring data isolation between different parallel contexts.
