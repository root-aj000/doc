This TypeScript file defines a class, `StreamingResponseFormatProcessor`, designed to intercept and transform data streams. Its primary purpose is to filter an incoming stream of JSON data, extracting only specific fields from the JSON payload rather than forwarding the entire object. This is particularly useful in scenarios where a service streams complex JSON, but the client only needs a few select pieces of information, thus optimizing bandwidth and client-side processing.

It acts as a specialized stream transformer, taking an original `ReadableStream` (likely containing JSON chunks) and producing a new `ReadableStream` that outputs only the desired field values.

Let's break down the code:

---

### File Overview

*   **Purpose:** To selectively extract specified fields from a JSON object that is being streamed, outputting only those extracted values. This avoids sending the full, potentially large, JSON wrapper object over the stream.
*   **Key Functionality:**
    *   Identifies which fields from a streamed JSON response are needed based on a configuration (`selectedOutputs`).
    *   Buffers incoming stream chunks until a complete or likely complete JSON object can be parsed.
    *   Extracts the values of the specified fields from the parsed JSON.
    *   Enqueues these extracted values into a new output stream, often separated by newlines.

---

### Detailed Explanation

```typescript
import { createLogger } from '@/lib/logs/console/logger'
import type { ResponseFormatStreamProcessor } from '@/executor/types'

// Initializes a logger instance for this file. This helps in debugging and monitoring
// by emitting informational messages, warnings, and errors.
const logger = createLogger('ExecutorUtils')
```

*   **`import { createLogger } from '@/lib/logs/console/logger'`**: Imports a utility function to create a logger. This is a common pattern for structured logging in applications.
*   **`import type { ResponseFormatStreamProcessor } from '@/executor/types'`**: Imports a TypeScript type definition. This interface likely defines the contract that this class must adhere to, ensuring it has a `processStream` method.
*   **`const logger = createLogger('ExecutorUtils')`**: Creates a logger instance named `ExecutorUtils`. All log messages originating from this file will be tagged with this name.

---

```typescript
/**
 * Processes a streaming response to extract only the selected response format fields
 * instead of streaming the full JSON wrapper.
 */
export class StreamingResponseFormatProcessor implements ResponseFormatStreamProcessor {
  processStream(
    originalStream: ReadableStream,
    blockId: string,
    selectedOutputs: string[],
    responseFormat?: any
  ): ReadableStream {
    // ... (explained below)
  }

  // ... (other methods explained below)
}
```

*   **`export class StreamingResponseFormatProcessor implements ResponseFormatStreamProcessor { ... }`**: Defines the main class responsible for processing the stream. It `implements` the `ResponseFormatStreamProcessor` interface, meaning it guarantees to have the methods defined by that interface (primarily `processStream`).

#### `processStream` Method

This is the public entry point for the stream processing logic. It determines if any filtering is needed and, if so, sets up the transformation.

```typescript
  processStream(
    originalStream: ReadableStream,
    blockId: string,
    selectedOutputs: string[],
    responseFormat?: any
  ): ReadableStream {
    // Check if this block has response format selected outputs
    const hasResponseFormatSelection = selectedOutputs.some((outputId) => {
      // Determines the block ID associated with a given outputId.
      // If outputId contains an underscore (e.g., "block1_fieldA"), it takes the part before the underscore.
      // Otherwise (e.g., "block1.fieldA"), it takes the part before the dot.
      const blockIdForOutput = outputId.includes('_')
        ? outputId.split('_')[0]
        : outputId.split('.')[0]
      // Returns true if the outputId belongs to the current blockId AND uses the underscore format
      // (which implies it's a field selected for streaming from a block).
      return blockIdForOutput === blockId && outputId.includes('_')
    })

    // If no response format selection is specified for this block, or no responseFormat object is provided,
    // return the original stream without any modifications.
    if (!hasResponseFormatSelection || !responseFormat) {
      return originalStream
    }

    // Get the selected field names for this block
    const selectedFields = selectedOutputs
      .filter((outputId) => {
        // Same logic as above to identify outputs belonging to this block and using the underscore format.
        const blockIdForOutput = outputId.includes('_')
          ? outputId.split('_')[0]
          : outputId.split('.')[0]
        return blockIdForOutput === blockId && outputId.includes('_')
      })
      .map((outputId) => outputId.substring(blockId.length + 1)) // Extracts just the field name (e.g., "fieldA" from "block1_fieldA").

    // Logs information about the stream processing for debugging.
    logger.info('Processing streaming response format', {
      blockId,
      selectedFields,
      hasResponseFormat: !!responseFormat, // Converts responseFormat to a boolean.
      selectedFieldsCount: selectedFields.length,
    })

    // Delegates the actual stream creation and processing to a private helper method.
    return this.createProcessedStream(originalStream, selectedFields, blockId)
  }
```

*   **`originalStream: ReadableStream`**: The input stream that contains the raw data (likely JSON chunks).
*   **`blockId: string`**: An identifier for the current processing block. Output selections are often prefixed with a block ID.
*   **`selectedOutputs: string[]`**: An array of strings, where each string represents a field that needs to be extracted. These are typically in the format `blockId_fieldName` or `blockId.fieldName`.
*   **`responseFormat?: any`**: An optional parameter that, if present and truthy, indicates that response formatting/filtering might be desired. Its actual content isn't directly used for filtering but its presence is a flag.

*   **`const hasResponseFormatSelection = selectedOutputs.some(...)`**: This line checks if any of the `selectedOutputs` are relevant to the current `blockId` and are formatted as `blockId_fieldName`.
    *   `outputId.includes('_') ? outputId.split('_')[0] : outputId.split('.')[0]`: This is a heuristic to extract the `blockId` prefix from an `outputId`. It checks for an underscore first, then a dot.
    *   `return blockIdForOutput === blockId && outputId.includes('_')`: It confirms that the extracted block ID matches the current `blockId` and, crucially, that the format *uses an underscore*. This implies that only fields specified with `blockId_fieldName` format are considered for streaming extraction.

*   **`if (!hasResponseFormatSelection || !responseFormat)`**: This is an early exit condition. If there are no `selectedOutputs` relevant to this `blockId` (and formatted correctly) or if `responseFormat` is not provided (or is falsy), the function returns the `originalStream` unchanged, meaning no filtering will occur.

*   **`const selectedFields = selectedOutputs.filter(...).map(...)`**: This block does two things:
    1.  **`filter(...)`**: It filters the `selectedOutputs` array, keeping only those entries that match the current `blockId` and use the `blockId_fieldName` format (same logic as `hasResponseFormatSelection`).
    2.  **`map(...)`**: For the remaining matched outputs, it transforms them by removing the `blockId_` prefix, leaving just the actual `fieldName`. For example, `block1_fieldA` becomes `fieldA`. These are the specific field names to extract from the JSON.

*   **`logger.info(...)`**: Logs diagnostic information about the processing being initiated, including the `blockId`, the specific `selectedFields`, and whether `responseFormat` was present.

*   **`return this.createProcessedStream(...)`**: Delegates the actual work of creating the new, filtered `ReadableStream` to a private helper method, `createProcessedStream`.

#### `createProcessedStream` Method

This private method is where the core stream transformation logic resides. It consumes the `originalStream` and produces a new `ReadableStream` with only the selected fields.

```typescript
  private createProcessedStream(
    originalStream: ReadableStream,
    selectedFields: string[],
    blockId: string
  ): ReadableStream {
    let buffer = '' // Accumulates incoming data chunks.
    let hasProcessedComplete = false // Flag to ensure complete JSON is processed only once.

    const self = this // Captures 'this' context for use inside the ReadableStream constructor.

    // Creates a new ReadableStream.
    return new ReadableStream({
      async start(controller) {
        // Gets a reader to pull data from the original stream.
        const reader = originalStream.getReader()
        // Decoder to convert binary data (Uint8Array) from the stream into text.
        const decoder = new TextDecoder()

        try {
          while (true) { // Continuously read chunks until the stream is done.
            const { done, value } = await reader.read() // Read a chunk.

            if (done) {
              // If the stream is finished:
              // Handle any remaining data in the buffer, but only if we haven't already processed a complete JSON object.
              if (buffer.trim() && !hasProcessedComplete) {
                self.processCompleteJson(buffer, selectedFields, controller)
              }
              controller.close() // Close the new stream.
              break // Exit the loop.
            }

            // Decode the binary chunk to a string and append it to the buffer.
            const chunk = decoder.decode(value, { stream: true })
            buffer += chunk

            // Attempt to process the current buffer, but only if a complete JSON hasn't been processed yet.
            if (!hasProcessedComplete) {
              const processedChunk = self.processStreamingChunk(buffer, selectedFields)

              if (processedChunk) {
                // If a chunk was successfully processed (i.e., selected fields extracted),
                // encode it back to binary and enqueue it into the new stream.
                controller.enqueue(new TextEncoder().encode(processedChunk))
                hasProcessedComplete = true // Mark as processed to prevent re-processing the same complete JSON.
              }
            }
          }
        } catch (error) {
          // Log any errors and propagate them to the new stream's controller.
          logger.error('Error processing streaming response format:', { error, blockId })
          controller.error(error)
        } finally {
          // Release the reader's lock on the original stream, allowing other readers if needed.
          reader.releaseLock()
        }
      },
    })
  }
```

*   **`buffer = ''`**: A string variable to accumulate data chunks received from the `originalStream`. JSON objects might arrive split across multiple chunks, so buffering is essential.
*   **`hasProcessedComplete = false`**: A boolean flag. This is crucial: it ensures that once a *complete* JSON object has been successfully parsed and its selected fields extracted, the `processStreamingChunk` logic won't attempt to re-process that same (now potentially larger) JSON again. This prevents duplicate output.
*   **`const self = this`**: Captures the current `this` context. Inside the `ReadableStream` constructor's methods (like `start`), `this` would refer to the stream controller, so `self` is used to access the class's methods.
*   **`return new ReadableStream({...})`**: Creates and returns a new `ReadableStream`. The object passed to its constructor defines how the stream behaves.
    *   **`async start(controller)`**: This method is called by the stream when it's ready to start producing data.
        *   **`const reader = originalStream.getReader()`**: Obtains a `ReadableStreamDefaultReader` to read data from the `originalStream`.
        *   **`const decoder = new TextDecoder()`**: An instance of `TextDecoder` is used to convert the `Uint8Array` (binary data) chunks received from the stream into human-readable strings.
        *   **`try...catch...finally`**: Standard error handling.
            *   **`while (true)`**: An infinite loop that continues until the `originalStream` is `done`.
            *   **`const { done, value } = await reader.read()`**: Reads the next chunk from the `originalStream`. `done` is `true` if there are no more chunks, `value` is the `Uint8Array` data.
            *   **`if (done)`**: If the stream has ended:
                *   **`if (buffer.trim() && !hasProcessedComplete)`**: Before closing, it checks if there's any remaining data in the `buffer` (after trimming whitespace) and if a complete JSON object hasn't *already* been processed. This is a final attempt to process any JSON that might have been received perfectly split at the end of the stream.
                *   **`self.processCompleteJson(...)`**: Calls a separate method to process the final buffer.
                *   **`controller.close()`**: Closes the *new* stream, signaling that no more data will be enqueued.
                *   **`break`**: Exits the `while` loop.
            *   **`const chunk = decoder.decode(value, { stream: true })`**: Decodes the binary `value` into a string `chunk`. `{ stream: true }` helps with multi-byte characters split across chunks.
            *   **`buffer += chunk`**: Appends the decoded `chunk` to the `buffer`.
            *   **`if (!hasProcessedComplete)`**: This condition ensures the main processing logic only runs if a complete JSON object hasn't been successfully extracted yet.
                *   **`const processedChunk = self.processStreamingChunk(buffer, selectedFields)`**: Calls `processStreamingChunk` to try and parse the accumulated `buffer` and extract fields.
                *   **`if (processedChunk)`**: If `processStreamingChunk` successfully extracted fields (i.e., returned a non-null string):
                    *   **`controller.enqueue(new TextEncoder().encode(processedChunk))`**: Encodes the extracted string back to `Uint8Array` and pushes it into the `new ReadableStream`.
                    *   **`hasProcessedComplete = true`**: Sets the flag to `true`, preventing `processStreamingChunk` from running again for the same logical JSON object. This is critical for efficiency and correctness.
            *   **`catch (error)`**: Logs and propagates any errors encountered during stream reading or processing.
            *   **`finally`**:
                *   **`reader.releaseLock()`**: Releases the lock on the `originalStream`'s reader. This is important to free up resources and allow other consumers to read from the stream if necessary.

#### `processStreamingChunk` Method

This private method attempts to parse the current `buffer` as a complete JSON object and extract the `selectedFields`. It's designed to be called repeatedly as more data arrives.

```typescript
  private processStreamingChunk(buffer: string, selectedFields: string[]): string | null {
    // For streaming response format, we need to parse the JSON as it comes in
    // and extract only the field values we care about

    // Try to parse as complete JSON first
    try {
      const parsed = JSON.parse(buffer.trim()) // Attempt to parse the entire buffered string as JSON.
      if (typeof parsed === 'object' && parsed !== null) {
        // We have a complete JSON object, extract the selected fields
        // Process all selected fields and format them properly
        const results: string[] = []
        for (const field of selectedFields) {
          if (field in parsed) { // Check if the field exists in the parsed JSON.
            const value = parsed[field] // Get the value of the field.
            // Format the value: if it's a string, use it directly; otherwise, stringify it.
            const formattedValue = typeof value === 'string' ? value : JSON.stringify(value)
            results.push(formattedValue)
          }
        }

        if (results.length > 0) {
          // If any fields were extracted, join them with newlines and return.
          const result = results.join('\n')
          return result
        }

        return null // No selected fields found.
      }
    } catch (e) {
      // If parsing fails, it means the JSON in the buffer is incomplete or malformed.
      // We catch the error and return null, indicating to continue buffering.
    }

    // This section is a heuristic and a "best effort" attempt.
    // For real-time extraction during streaming, we'd need more sophisticated parsing
    // For now, let's handle the case where we receive chunks that might be partial JSON

    // Simple heuristic: if buffer contains what looks like a complete JSON object
    // Count opening and closing curly braces.
    const openBraces = (buffer.match(/\{/g) || []).length
    const closeBraces = (buffer.match(/\}/g) || []).length

    if (openBraces > 0 && openBraces === closeBraces) {
      // If there are braces and they match, it's *likely* a complete JSON object.
      try {
        const parsed = JSON.parse(buffer.trim()) // Try parsing again.
        if (typeof parsed === 'object' && parsed !== null) {
          // Process all selected fields and format them properly (same logic as above).
          const results: string[] = []
          for (const field of selectedFields) {
            if (field in parsed) {
              const value = parsed[field]
              const formattedValue = typeof value === 'string' ? value : JSON.stringify(value)
              results.push(formattedValue)
            }
          }

          if (results.length > 0) {
            const result = results.join('\n')
            return result
          }

          return null
        }
      } catch (e) {
        // Still not valid JSON, continue to return null.
      }
    }

    return null // Return null if no complete and valid JSON object could be parsed and processed.
  }
```

*   **`buffer: string`**: The accumulated string data received from the `originalStream`.
*   **`selectedFields: string[]`**: The names of the fields to extract (e.g., `["fieldA", "fieldB"]`).
*   **Return: `string | null`**: Returns the extracted and formatted field values (joined by newlines) if successful, otherwise `null`.

*   **First `try...catch` block (`JSON.parse(buffer.trim())`)**:
    *   This is the primary attempt to parse the *entire* `buffer` as a complete JSON object.
    *   `buffer.trim()` removes leading/trailing whitespace, which is important.
    *   If `JSON.parse` is successful and results in an object:
        *   It iterates through `selectedFields`.
        *   **`if (field in parsed)`**: Checks if the desired `field` exists in the parsed JSON object.
        *   **`const formattedValue = typeof value === 'string' ? value : JSON.stringify(value)`**: Formats the extracted value. If it's already a string, it's used directly. Otherwise (e.g., number, boolean, array, nested object), it's converted to its JSON string representation.
        *   The formatted values are pushed into `results`.
        *   **`if (results.length > 0)`**: If any fields were extracted, they are joined by newline characters (`\n`) and returned as a single string.
        *   If no selected fields were found or extracted, it returns `null`.
    *   **`catch (e)`**: If `JSON.parse` throws an error, it means the `buffer` does not contain a complete or valid JSON string yet. The `catch` block simply ignores the error, causing the function to fall through and potentially try the heuristic, or ultimately return `null`.

*   **Heuristic Block (`openBraces`, `closeBraces`)**:
    *   This section acts as a secondary, more optimistic check. It's a simple heuristic to guess if the `buffer` *might* contain a complete JSON object even if the first `try...catch` failed.
    *   It counts the number of opening (`{`) and closing (`}`) curly braces.
    *   **`if (openBraces > 0 && openBraces === closeBraces)`**: If there are any braces and their counts match, it *assumes* it might be a complete JSON object.
    *   It then attempts `JSON.parse(buffer.trim())` again within another `try...catch` block, using the same extraction logic as before.
    *   **Important Note:** This heuristic is simple and can be misleading for complex or malformed JSON (e.g., a string field containing `{}`). For robust real-time partial JSON parsing, more sophisticated streaming JSON parsers are typically needed. However, for relatively simple top-level JSON objects, this might be sufficient.

*   **`return null`**: If neither of the parsing attempts succeeds, the function returns `null`, indicating that no processable JSON object was found in the current `buffer`.

#### `processCompleteJson` Method

This private method is specifically designed to process any *remaining* `buffer` data once the `originalStream` has ended (`done` is `true`). It acts as a final cleanup or fallback, ensuring that any last, complete JSON object is handled.

```typescript
  private processCompleteJson(
    buffer: string,
    selectedFields: string[],
    controller: ReadableStreamDefaultController
  ): void {
    try {
      const parsed = JSON.parse(buffer.trim()) // Attempt to parse the final buffered string.
      if (typeof parsed === 'object' && parsed !== null) {
        // Process all selected fields and format them properly (same extraction logic as processStreamingChunk).
        const results: string[] = []
        for (const field of selectedFields) {
          if (field in parsed) {
            const value = parsed[field]
            const formattedValue = typeof value === 'string' ? value : JSON.stringify(value)
            results.push(formattedValue)
          }
        }

        if (results.length > 0) {
          // If fields were extracted, join them and enqueue them into the output stream.
          const result = results.join('\n')
          controller.enqueue(new TextEncoder().encode(result))
        }
      }
    } catch (error) {
      // Log a warning if the final buffer could not be parsed as JSON.
      logger.warn('Failed to parse complete JSON in streaming processor:', { error })
    }
  }
```

*   This method's core logic for parsing and extracting fields is identical to that in `processStreamingChunk`.
*   The key difference is that it takes the `controller` of the new `ReadableStream` directly as a parameter. Instead of returning a string, it directly calls `controller.enqueue()` to push the final processed data onto the stream.
*   **`logger.warn(...)`**: If `JSON.parse` fails here, it logs a warning because, at this point, all data has been received, and failure implies a malformed JSON payload at the very end of the stream.

---

### Singleton Instance

```typescript
// Create singleton instance
export const streamingResponseFormatProcessor = new StreamingResponseFormatProcessor()
```

*   **`export const streamingResponseFormatProcessor = new StreamingResponseFormatProcessor()`**: This line creates a single instance of `StreamingResponseFormatProcessor` and exports it as `streamingResponseFormatProcessor`. This is a common "singleton" pattern, meaning that throughout the application, there will only be one instance of this processor, which can be imported and reused wherever needed. This avoids creating multiple instances unnecessarily and can help manage resources.

---

### Simplified Complex Logic

1.  **Output ID Parsing (`blockIdForOutput`):** The logic `outputId.includes('_') ? outputId.split('_')[0] : outputId.split('.')[0]` is designed to extract the "block identifier" from a full output path (e.g., `myBlock_fieldX` or `myBlock.fieldY`). The preference for `_` indicates a specific format intended for direct streaming extraction, while `.` might be for other purposes or simply a fallback. The `outputId.substring(blockId.length + 1)` then isolates the actual field name (e.g., `fieldX`).
2.  **Stream Buffering and Processing:** The `createProcessedStream` method works like an assembly line:
    *   It continuously receives small chunks of data.
    *   These chunks are added to a growing `buffer`.
    *   The `processStreamingChunk` method repeatedly attempts to look at the `buffer`. If the `buffer` contains what looks like a complete JSON object (either perfectly parsable or matching the brace heuristic), it extracts the desired fields.
    *   **Crucially, `hasProcessedComplete`** ensures that once a complete JSON object has been successfully processed and its fields extracted, the system *stops* trying to re-extract from the same (now potentially larger) buffer. This means it's expecting one main JSON object per "stream session" for selective extraction.
    *   `processCompleteJson` is a safety net for when the stream ends to catch any final, complete JSON that might be left in the buffer.
3.  **JSON Parsing Strategy:** The processor is designed to extract fields from *complete* JSON objects within the stream, not partial ones. While it buffers and uses a brace-counting heuristic, its extraction logic always relies on `JSON.parse` successfully creating a full JavaScript object from the accumulated buffer. It does not attempt to parse and extract fields from truly fragmented JSON (e.g., extracting `"name": "Alice"` from a buffer containing just `{"name": "Alice", "age":`). It waits for `{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}` to be complete in the buffer.

This file provides an efficient way to filter JSON data from a `ReadableStream`, ensuring that only the relevant information is propagated downstream, thereby optimizing data transfer and processing.
