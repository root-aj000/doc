This TypeScript file defines a robust background task for delivering webhooks when a workflow execution in your system completes. It's built using the `@trigger.dev/sdk` which implies it's part of a managed job processing system designed for reliability, retries, and long-running operations.

---

## 📄 Purpose of This File

The primary purpose of this file is to create and manage the delivery of "workflow execution completed" webhooks to external systems. When a workflow finishes (successfully or with an error), this task is triggered to:

1.  **Construct a detailed payload** about the workflow's outcome.
2.  **Sign the payload** for security and verification by the recipient (if a secret is configured).
3.  **Attempt to deliver the webhook** to the configured URL.
4.  **Implement a sophisticated retry strategy** with exponential backoff and jitter for transient failures (network issues, temporary server outages).
5.  **Record the delivery status** (pending, in\_progress, success, failed) and attempt details in the database.
6.  **Handle timeouts and unexpected errors** gracefully.

In essence, it acts as the "post office" for workflow completion notifications, ensuring they are delivered reliably and securely.

## 🎯 Simplifying Complex Logic

Let's break down the most complex aspects:

1.  **Atomic Delivery Claiming:**
    *   **Problem:** Multiple instances of this task might try to process the *same* webhook delivery simultaneously (e.g., if a previous attempt failed and the task was re-queued).
    *   **Solution:** The database update that changes the `workflowLogWebhookDelivery` status from `pending` to `in_progress` is designed to be **atomic**. It uses a `WHERE` clause that checks `status = 'pending'` and also ensures the `nextAttemptAt` time has passed. If another task instance already claimed it, or it's not yet time for a retry, the `update` operation will affect zero rows, and the current task instance will gracefully exit, preventing duplicate deliveries or race conditions. The `returning` clause helps retrieve the new `attempts` count after the atomic increment.

2.  **Internal Retry Strategy vs. External Task Retries:**
    *   **Problem:** `@trigger.dev/sdk` provides its own retry mechanism (`retry` option in `task` definition). However, for more fine-grained control (e.g., exponential backoff, jitter, specific HTTP status code handling, and database updates for each attempt), you often need to manage retries *within* the task itself.
    *   **Solution:**
        *   The task is configured with `retry: { maxAttempts: 1 }`. This tells Trigger.dev *not* to automatically retry if the `run` function throws an unhandled error.
        *   Instead, when a retryable error occurs (HTTP 5xx, 429, or network errors/timeouts), the task:
            1.  **Calculates a delay** using `RETRY_DELAYS` (exponential backoff) and `getRetryDelayWithJitter` (adds randomness).
            2.  **Updates the database** to set the delivery status back to `pending` and `nextAttemptAt` to the calculated future time.
            3.  **Uses `await wait.for(...)`** to pause its execution for the calculated delay.
            4.  **Calls `logsWebhookDelivery.trigger(...)` recursively.** This is the key! It re-queues *itself* with the exact same parameters, essentially telling Trigger.dev: "I need to run again later with the same job." This allows Trigger.dev to handle the queuing and resource management for the retry, while the task itself controls the *logic* of when and how to retry.

3.  **Webhook Signature Generation:**
    *   **Problem:** How to ensure the webhook recipient can verify that the request truly came from your system and hasn't been tampered with?
    *   **Solution:** Implement a HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) signature.
        *   A shared `secret` (known by both sender and receiver) is used.
        *   The signature is generated by hashing a combination of the current timestamp and the request body using `createHmac('sha256', secret)`.
        *   This signature is sent in a custom `sim-signature` header. The recipient can then re-generate the signature with their copy of the secret and compare it to the received signature. If they match, the request is authentic.
