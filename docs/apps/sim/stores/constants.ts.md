This TypeScript file acts as a central hub for defining key constants and types used throughout an application, primarily for managing API endpoints and handling messages related to an AI "Copilot" feature.

It promotes **consistency** by consolidating common strings and URLs, making the code more **readable** and **maintainable**. Instead of scattering literal strings throughout the codebase (which are often called "magic strings"), this file provides named constants that are easier to understand and update.

---

### **Detailed Explanation**

Let's break down each part of the code:

### 1. API Endpoints Configuration

```typescript
export const API_ENDPOINTS = {
  ENVIRONMENT: '/api/environment',
  SCHEDULE: '/api/schedules',
  SETTINGS: '/api/settings',
  WORKFLOWS: '/api/workflows',
  WORKSPACE_PERMISSIONS: (id: string) => `/api/workspaces/${id}/permissions`,
  WORKSPACE_ENVIRONMENT: (id: string) => `/api/workspaces/${id}/environment`,
}
```

*   **Purpose:** This object (`API_ENDPOINTS`) serves as a definitive list of all the backend API routes (URLs) that your frontend application will communicate with. This prevents you from having to type out these URLs repeatedly in your network requests, reducing errors and making changes easier.

*   **Simplifying Complex Logic:** The "complexity" here is in managing URLs that can be either static or dynamic. This object handles both gracefully.

*   **Line-by-Line Explanation:**
    *   `export const API_ENDPOINTS = {`: This declares a constant JavaScript object named `API_ENDPOINTS`. The `export` keyword makes this object available for other files in your project to import and use.
    *   `ENVIRONMENT: '/api/environment',`: Defines a static API path for operations related to the application's environment. When you need to fetch or update environment-wide settings, you'd use `API_ENDPOINTS.ENVIRONMENT`.
    *   `SCHEDULE: '/api/schedules',`: A static API path for managing schedules within the application.
    *   `SETTINGS: '/api/settings',`: A static API path for application-wide settings.
    *   `WORKFLOWS: '/api/workflows',`: A static API path for interacting with workflows.
    *   `WORKSPACE_PERMISSIONS: (id: string) => `/api/workspaces/${id}/permissions`,`: This is a function that generates an API path. Unlike the previous entries, this endpoint requires a specific `id` (e.g., a workspace ID) to construct the full URL. When you call `API_ENDPOINTS.WORKSPACE_PERMISSIONS('my-workspace-id')`, it will return the string `/api/workspaces/my-workspace-id/permissions`. This is useful for fetching data specific to a particular resource.
    *   `WORKSPACE_ENVIRONMENT: (id: string) => `/api/workspaces/${id}/environment`,`: Similar to the previous entry, this is another function that generates an API path for a specific workspace's environment, based on the provided `id`.

### 2. Copilot Tool Name Mappings

These three objects (`COPILOT_TOOL_DISPLAY_NAMES`, `COPILOT_TOOL_PAST_TENSE`, `COPILOT_TOOL_ERROR_NAMES`) are designed to provide different user-facing text for the same internal "Copilot" (AI assistant) tools, depending on the context (e.g., currently running, completed, or failed).

The internal identifier for each tool (e.g., `search_documentation`) remains consistent, but its textual representation changes to be more descriptive and user-friendly in the UI.

#### `COPILOT_TOOL_DISPLAY_NAMES`

```typescript
export const COPILOT_TOOL_DISPLAY_NAMES: Record<string, string> = {
  search_documentation: 'Searching documentation',
  get_user_workflow: 'Analyzing your workflow',
  // ... more entries ...
  plan: 'Designing an approach',
  reason: 'Reasoning about your workflow',
} as const
```

*   **Purpose:** This object maps an internal Copilot tool ID (e.g., `search_documentation`) to a human-readable phrase indicating the tool's *current action* or its general display name. This is likely used to show real-time progress to the user (e.g., "Copilot is now: *Searching documentation*").

*   **Simplifying Complex Logic:** Instead of having `if/else` statements or `switch` cases to determine what text to show when a tool is active, you simply look up its ID in this map.

*   **Line-by-Line Explanation:**
    *   `export const COPILOT_TOOL_DISPLAY_NAMES: Record<string, string> = {`: Declares a constant object named `COPILOT_TOOL_DISPLAY_NAMES`.
        *   `: Record<string, string>`: This is a TypeScript type annotation. It specifies that this object is a dictionary where both the keys (like `search_documentation`) and the values (like `'Searching documentation'`) are strings.
    *   `search_documentation: 'Searching documentation',`: This is an entry mapping the internal tool ID `search_documentation` to the display text `'Searching documentation'`.
    *   `(other entries)`: All other lines follow the same pattern, providing a display name for each unique Copilot tool ID.
    *   `} as const`: This is a TypeScript feature called a "const assertion". It tells TypeScript to infer the narrowest possible type for this object. Crucially, it makes the keys (e.g., `search_documentation`) literal string types (`'search_documentation'`) rather than just `string`. This is vital for the `CopilotToolId` type definition later. It also makes the object deeply read-only.

#### `COPILOT_TOOL_PAST_TENSE`

```typescript
export const COPILOT_TOOL_PAST_TENSE: Record<string, string> = {
  search_documentation: 'Searched documentation',
  get_user_workflow: 'Analyzed your workflow',
  // ... more entries ...
  plan: 'Designed an approach',
  reason: 'Finished reasoning',
} as const
```

*   **Purpose:** Similar to `COPILOT_TOOL_DISPLAY_NAMES`, but this object provides the *past tense* description for each Copilot tool. This is likely used when a tool has successfully completed its operation (e.g., "Copilot *Searched documentation*").

*   **Simplifying Complex Logic:** Provides a consistent way to show "completion" messages without manual string manipulation.

*   **Line-by-Line Explanation:**
    *   `export const COPILOT_TOOL_PAST_TENSE: Record<string, string> = {`: Declares another constant object, `COPILOT_TOOL_PAST_TENSE`, with the same `Record<string, string>` type annotation.
    *   `search_documentation: 'Searched documentation',`: Maps the internal tool ID `search_documentation` to its past tense phrase `'Searched documentation'`.
    *   `(other entries)`: All other lines provide the past tense form for their respective tool IDs.
    *   `} as const`: Similar `as const` assertion for narrowest type inference and immutability.

#### `COPILOT_TOOL_ERROR_NAMES`

```typescript
export const COPILOT_TOOL_ERROR_NAMES: Record<string, string> = {
  search_documentation: 'Errored searching documentation',
  get_user_workflow: 'Errored analyzing your workflow',
  // ... more entries ...
  plan: 'Errored planning approach',
  reason: 'Errored reasoning through problem',
} as const
```

*   **Purpose:** This object provides specific error messages for each Copilot tool. If a tool fails, the application can look up its ID here to display a relevant and user-friendly error message (e.g., "Copilot *Errored searching documentation*").

*   **Simplifying Complex Logic:** Centralizes error message strings, making error handling UI consistent and easier to manage.

*   **Line-by-Line Explanation:**
    *   `export const COPILOT_TOOL_ERROR_NAMES: Record<string, string> = {`: Declares the `COPILOT_TOOL_ERROR_NAMES` constant object, again with the `Record<string, string>` type.
    *   `search_documentation: 'Errored searching documentation',`: Maps `search_documentation` to its error message `'Errored searching documentation'`.
    *   `(other entries)`: All other lines provide the error message for their corresponding tool IDs.
    *   `} as const`: Similar `as const` assertion.

### 3. Copilot Tool ID Type Definition

```typescript
export type CopilotToolId = keyof typeof COPILOT_TOOL_DISPLAY_NAMES
```

*   **Purpose:** This line defines a new TypeScript type called `CopilotToolId`. This type represents a union of all the valid string literal keys found in the `COPILOT_TOOL_DISPLAY_NAMES` object. This provides strong type safety: any variable declared as `CopilotToolId` can only hold one of the exact string IDs defined in that object (e.g., `'search_documentation'`, `'get_user_workflow'`, etc.), preventing typos and ensuring that you're always using a known tool ID.

*   **Simplifying Complex Logic:** Instead of manually creating a union type like `'search_documentation' | 'get_user_workflow' | ...`, this type automatically derives it from the existing data structure. If you add a new tool to `COPILOT_TOOL_DISPLAY_NAMES`, `CopilotToolId` automatically updates. This is incredibly powerful for maintainability.

*   **Line-by-Line Explanation:**
    *   `export type CopilotToolId =`: Declares a new type alias named `CopilotToolId`, making it accessible to other files.
    *   `keyof typeof COPILOT_TOOL_DISPLAY_NAMES`: This is a powerful TypeScript construct:
        *   `typeof COPILOT_TOOL_DISPLAY_NAMES`: This operator gets the *type* of the `COPILOT_TOOL_DISPLAY_NAMES` constant. Because `COPILOT_TOOL_DISPLAY_NAMES` was defined with `as const`, TypeScript knows its precise structure, including that its keys are literal strings like `'search_documentation'`, not just any generic `string`.
        *   `keyof ...`: This operator then takes the type of `COPILOT_TOOL_DISPLAY_NAMES` and extracts all its property names (keys) as a [union type](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#union-types).
        *   **Result:** `CopilotToolId` becomes a union type like `'search_documentation' | 'get_user_workflow' | 'get_blocks_and_tools' | ...` (containing all the keys from the `COPILOT_TOOL_DISPLAY_NAMES` object).

By centralizing these definitions, the file ensures consistency, reduces the chance of errors, and makes it much easier to manage and scale the application's API communication and AI assistant's user interface messaging.
