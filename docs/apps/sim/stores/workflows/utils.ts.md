import type { BlockState, SubBlockState } from '@/stores/workflows/workflow/types'

/**
 * Normalizes a block name for comparison by converting to lowercase and removing spaces
 * @param name - The block name to normalize
 * @returns The normalized name
 */
export function normalizeBlockName(name: string): string {
  return name.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, '')
}
```

**Purpose:** This function takes a block name as input and returns a normalized version of the name. Normalization involves converting the name to lowercase and removing all spaces. This is useful for comparing block names in a case-insensitive and space-insensitive manner.

**Line-by-line explanation:**

- `export function normalizeBlockName(name: string): string {`: This line defines a function named `normalizeBlockName`.
    - `export`:  Makes the function available for use in other modules.
    - `function`: Declares a function.
    - `normalizeBlockName`: The name of the function.
    - `(name: string)`:  Specifies that the function accepts a single argument named `name` which must be a string.
    - `: string`: Indicates that the function returns a string value.
- `return name.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, '')`:  This line performs the normalization and returns the result.
    - `name.toLowerCase()`: Converts the input string `name` to lowercase.
    - `.replace(/\s+/g, '')`:  Replaces all occurrences of one or more whitespace characters (`\s+`) with an empty string (`''`). The `g` flag ensures that all occurrences are replaced, not just the first.
    - `return`: Returns the normalized string.

```typescript
/**
 * Generates a unique block name by finding the highest number suffix among existing blocks
 * with the same base name and incrementing it
 * @param baseName - The base name for the block (e.g., "API 1", "Agent", "Loop 3")
 * @param existingBlocks - Record of existing blocks to check against
 * @returns A unique block name with an appropriate number suffix
 */
export function getUniqueBlockName(baseName: string, existingBlocks: Record<string, any>): string {
  const baseNameMatch = baseName.match(/^(.*?)(\s+\d+)?$/)
  const namePrefix = baseNameMatch ? baseNameMatch[1].trim() : baseName

  const normalizedBase = normalizeBlockName(namePrefix)

  const existingNumbers = Object.values(existingBlocks)
    .filter((block) => {
      const blockNameMatch = block.name?.match(/^(.*?)(\s+\d+)?$/)
      const blockPrefix = blockNameMatch ? blockNameMatch[1].trim() : block.name
      return blockPrefix && normalizeBlockName(blockPrefix) === normalizedBase
    })
    .map((block) => {
      const match = block.name?.match(/(\d+)$/)
      return match ? Number.parseInt(match[1], 10) : 0
    })

  const maxNumber = existingNumbers.length > 0 ? Math.max(...existingNumbers) : 0

  if (maxNumber === 0 && existingNumbers.length === 0) {
    return `${namePrefix} 1`
  }

  return `${namePrefix} ${maxNumber + 1}`
}
```

**Purpose:**  This function generates a unique name for a new block within a workflow. It takes a desired `baseName` and a record of `existingBlocks` as input.  The function checks if blocks with the same base name already exist and, if so, finds the highest numbered suffix attached to the base name.  It then increments this number and returns a new name in the format "baseName number".  If no blocks with the same base name exist, it returns "baseName 1".

**Line-by-line explanation:**

- `export function getUniqueBlockName(baseName: string, existingBlocks: Record<string, any>): string {`: Defines the function signature.
    - `export`:  Makes the function available for use in other modules.
    - `function getUniqueBlockName`:  Declares a function named `getUniqueBlockName`.
    - `(baseName: string, existingBlocks: Record<string, any>)`: Specifies the function's arguments.
        - `baseName: string`:  The desired base name for the new block.
        - `existingBlocks: Record<string, any>`:  A record (object) where the keys are block IDs and the values are the block objects.  The `any` type indicates that the block objects can have any structure.
    - `: string`: Indicates that the function returns a string (the unique block name).

- `const baseNameMatch = baseName.match(/^(.*?)(\s+\d+)?$/)`:  This line uses a regular expression to extract the base name prefix from the input `baseName`.
    - `baseName.match(/^(.*?)(\s+\d+)?$/)`:  Applies a regular expression to the `baseName`. Let's break down the regex:
        - `^`: Matches the beginning of the string.
        - `(.*?)`: Captures any character (`.`) zero or more times (`*?`) in a non-greedy way.  This captures the base name *before* any potential number suffix.  The parentheses create a capturing group.
        - `(\s+\d+)?`:  This is an optional group (due to the `?` at the end) that matches a space followed by one or more digits.
            - `\s+`: Matches one or more whitespace characters.
            - `\d+`: Matches one or more digits.
        - `$`: Matches the end of the string.
    - `const baseNameMatch`: Stores the result of the `match` operation.  If the `baseName` matches the regex, `baseNameMatch` will be an array containing the matched string and capturing groups. Otherwise, it will be `null`.

- `const namePrefix = baseNameMatch ? baseNameMatch[1].trim() : baseName`:  This line determines the `namePrefix` based on the result of the regex match.
    - `baseNameMatch ? ... : ...`:  This is a ternary operator. If `baseNameMatch` is truthy (i.e., not `null`), the expression after the `?` is evaluated.  Otherwise, the expression after the `:` is evaluated.
    - `baseNameMatch[1].trim()`:  If `baseNameMatch` is not `null`, this extracts the first capturing group from the `baseNameMatch` array (which is the base name prefix) and then removes any leading or trailing whitespace using `trim()`.
    - `baseName`: If `baseNameMatch` is `null` (meaning the regex didn't match, and the input `baseName` likely doesn't have a number suffix), the `namePrefix` is simply set to the original `baseName`.

- `const normalizedBase = normalizeBlockName(namePrefix)`: Normalizes the identified `namePrefix` using the `normalizeBlockName` function (converts to lowercase and removes spaces). This ensures consistent comparison of block names.

- `const existingNumbers = Object.values(existingBlocks) ...`: This line extracts the numeric suffixes from the existing blocks that share the same base name.
    - `Object.values(existingBlocks)`: Extracts the values (block objects) from the `existingBlocks` record into an array.
    - `.filter((block) => { ... })`: Filters the array of block objects to keep only those that have the same base name as the new block.
        - `const blockNameMatch = block.name?.match(/^(.*?)(\s+\d+)?$/)`:  Similar to the `baseNameMatch` logic, this extracts the base name from the current `block` being processed in the filter. The `?.` operator allows for safe access to the `name` property, preventing errors if it's null or undefined.
        - `const blockPrefix = blockNameMatch ? blockNameMatch[1].trim() : block.name`: Extracts the prefix from the block name.
        - `return blockPrefix && normalizeBlockName(blockPrefix) === normalizedBase`: The filter condition. It returns `true` if:
            - `blockPrefix` exists (is not null or undefined).
            - The normalized version of `blockPrefix` is equal to the `normalizedBase` (normalized version of the new block's `namePrefix`).
    - `.map((block) => { ... })`: Maps the filtered array of block objects to an array of numeric suffixes.
        - `const match = block.name?.match(/(\d+)$/)`:  This uses a regular expression to extract the number at the end of the block name.
            - `(\d+)$`:  Matches one or more digits (`\d+`) at the end of the string (`$`). The parentheses create a capturing group containing the digits.
        - `return match ? Number.parseInt(match[1], 10) : 0`:  If a number is found at the end of the block name, it's converted to an integer using `Number.parseInt(match[1], 10)` (the `10` specifies base-10). If no number is found, it returns 0.

- `const maxNumber = existingNumbers.length > 0 ? Math.max(...existingNumbers) : 0`:  Determines the maximum number suffix among the existing blocks.
    - `existingNumbers.length > 0 ? ... : ...`:  Ternary operator that checks if the `existingNumbers` array has any elements.
    - `Math.max(...existingNumbers)`:  If `existingNumbers` has elements, this uses the `Math.max` function to find the maximum value in the array. The spread syntax (`...`) expands the array into individual arguments for the `Math.max` function.
    - `0`: If `existingNumbers` is empty, it sets `maxNumber` to 0.

- `if (maxNumber === 0 && existingNumbers.length === 0) { return `${namePrefix} 1` }`:  This condition handles the case where no blocks with the same base name exist.
    - `maxNumber === 0 && existingNumbers.length === 0`: Checks if the `maxNumber` is 0 and the `existingNumbers` array is empty. This indicates that no blocks with the same base name and a numeric suffix exist.
    - `return `${namePrefix} 1``: If the condition is true, it returns a new block name in the format "baseName 1".

- `return `${namePrefix} ${maxNumber + 1}``:  This line returns the unique block name by incrementing the `maxNumber` and appending it to the `namePrefix`.

**Purpose:** This function merges the state of workflow blocks with values stored for their sub-blocks in a sub-block store.  It aims to update the `value` property of each sub-block with the corresponding value from the store, if it exists. The function handles cases where the sub-block configurations might have changed, ensuring that any orphaned values (values in the store that no longer have a corresponding sub-block in the block configuration) are also included.  It provides flexibility to merge sub-block states for a specific workflow or a specific block within a workflow.

**Line-by-line explanation:**

- `export function mergeSubblockState( blocks: Record<string, BlockState>, workflowId?: string, blockId?: string ): Record<string, BlockState> {`: Defines the function signature.
    - `export`:  Makes the function available for use in other modules.
    - `function mergeSubblockState`:  Declares the function name.
    - `(blocks: Record<string, BlockState>, workflowId?: string, blockId?: string)`: Specifies the function's arguments.
        - `blocks: Record<string, BlockState>`:  A record (object) where the keys are block IDs and the values are `BlockState` objects. Represents the initial state of the blocks.
        - `workflowId?: string`: An optional string representing the ID of the workflow. If provided, the function will retrieve sub-block values specifically for this workflow. The `?` indicates that it's optional.
        - `blockId?: string`: An optional string representing the ID of a specific block. If provided, the function will only merge sub-block states for this block. The `?` indicates that it's optional.
    - `: Record<string, BlockState>`:  Indicates that the function returns a record (object) where the keys are block IDs and the values are the merged `BlockState` objects.

- `const blocksToProcess = blockId ? { [blockId]: blocks[blockId] } : blocks`: This line determines which blocks to process based on whether a `blockId` was provided.
    - `blockId ? ... : ...`:  A ternary operator that checks if `blockId` is truthy (i.e., not `null`, `undefined`, or an empty string).
    - `{ [blockId]: blocks[blockId] }`: If `blockId` is provided, this creates a new object containing only the block with the specified `blockId`. The `[blockId]` syntax is used for creating an object with a dynamic key.
    - `blocks`: If `blockId` is not provided, this simply uses the original `blocks` object, meaning all blocks will be processed.

- `const subBlockStore = useSubBlockStore.getState()`: This line retrieves the current state of the sub-block store.
    - `useSubBlockStore`: Assumed to be a function from a state management library (like Zustand, Pinia, or Vuex) that provides access to the sub-block store.
    - `.getState()`: A method provided by the state management library to retrieve the current state of the store.

- `const workflowSubblockValues = workflowId ? subBlockStore.workflowValues[workflowId] || {} : {}`:  This line retrieves the sub-block values for the specified workflow, if a `workflowId` is provided.
    - `workflowId ? ... : ...`: Ternary operator that checks if `workflowId` is provided.
    - `subBlockStore.workflowValues[workflowId] || {}`: If `workflowId` is provided, this attempts to retrieve the values for that workflow from the `workflowValues` property of the sub-block store. The `|| {}` provides a default empty object if no values are found for the given `workflowId`.
    - `{}`: If `workflowId` is not provided, an empty object is assigned to `workflowSubblockValues`. This means that it will rely on the store's `getValue` function, which likely uses some kind of active workflow context.

- `return Object.entries(blocksToProcess).reduce( (acc, [id, block]) => { ... }, {} as Record<string, BlockState>)`:  This is the main part of the function, which iterates over the blocks and merges their sub-block states.
    - `Object.entries(blocksToProcess)`: Converts the `blocksToProcess` object into an array of key-value pairs (arrays of `[key, value]`). In this case, the keys are block IDs and the values are `BlockState` objects.
    - `.reduce((acc, [id, block]) => { ... }, {} as Record<string, BlockState>)`:  Applies a `reduce` operation to the array of key-value pairs. The `reduce` function iterates over the array and accumulates a result.
        - `acc`: The accumulator. This is the object that will eventually be returned, containing the merged block states.  It's initialized as an empty object (`{}`) of type `Record<string, BlockState>`.
        - `[id, block]`:  Destructuring assignment that extracts the block ID (`id`) and the `BlockState` object (`block`) from each key-value pair.
        - `=> { ... }`: The callback function that's executed for each element in the array. This function merges the sub-block states for the current block and updates the accumulator.

- `if (!block) { return acc }`:  This line checks if the current `block` is defined.  If not (e.g., if the block ID doesn't exist), it simply returns the accumulator without making any changes.

- `const blockSubBlocks = block.subBlocks || {}`: This line safely accesses the `subBlocks` property of the current `block`. If `block.subBlocks` is `null` or `undefined`, it defaults to an empty object. This prevents errors if a block doesn't have any sub-blocks.

- `const blockValues = workflowSubblockValues[id] || {}`: This line retrieves the stored values for the sub-blocks of the current block. It looks up the block's ID (`id`) in the `workflowSubblockValues` object. If no values are found for that block ID, it defaults to an empty object.

- `const mergedSubBlocks = Object.entries(blockSubBlocks).reduce( (subAcc, [subBlockId, subBlock]) => { ... }, {} as Record<string, SubBlockState>)`: This line iterates over the sub-blocks of the current block and merges their states with the stored values. It's another `reduce` operation, nested inside the outer `reduce`.
    - `Object.entries(blockSubBlocks)`: Converts the `blockSubBlocks` object into an array of key-value pairs (arrays of `[key, value]`). In this case, the keys are sub-block IDs and the values are `SubBlockState` objects.
    - `.reduce((subAcc, [subBlockId, subBlock]) => { ... }, {} as Record<string, SubBlockState>)`:  Applies a `reduce` operation to the array of key-value pairs.
        - `subAcc`:  The accumulator for the sub-block merging process. It's initialized as an empty object (`{}`) of type `Record<string, SubBlockState>`.
        - `[subBlockId, subBlock]`:  Destructuring assignment that extracts the sub-block ID (`subBlockId`) and the `SubBlockState` object (`subBlock`) from each key-value pair.
        - `=> { ... }`: The callback function that's executed for each element in the array. This function merges the state of the current sub-block with the stored value and updates the `subAcc` accumulator.

- `if (!subBlock) { return subAcc }`:  This line checks if the current `subBlock` is defined.  If not, it simply returns the `subAcc` without making any changes.

- `let storedValue = null`: Initializes the `storedValue` to `null`. This will hold the value retrieved from the store for the current sub-block.

-  The next block of code conditionally retrieves `storedValue` based on the presence of `workflowId`.
    - `if (workflowId) { ... } else { ... }`: conditional statement to branch the logic based on `workflowId`
        - `if (workflowId) { if (blockValues[subBlockId] !== undefined) {storedValue = blockValues[subBlockId]} }` checks for `workflowId`, then checks if there's a value associated with `subBlockId` within the `blockValues` object, which itself is derived from the `workflowSubblockValues`. If a value exists (i.e., it's not `undefined`), it's assigned to `storedValue`.
        - `else { storedValue = subBlockStore.getValue(id, subBlockId) }`: if `workflowId` isn't present it falls back to using the `getValue` function in `subBlockStore` passing in `id` and `subBlockId`

- `subAcc[subBlockId] = { ...subBlock, value: storedValue !== undefined && storedValue !== null ? storedValue : subBlock.value, }`:  This line creates a new sub-block object with the merged state and adds it to the `subAcc` accumulator.
    - `...subBlock`: Creates a shallow copy of the original `subBlock` object.
    - `value: storedValue !== undefined && storedValue !== null ? storedValue : subBlock.value`:  This line determines the value of the `value` property for the new sub-block object. It uses a ternary operator to check if `storedValue` is defined (not `undefined` or `null`). If `storedValue` is defined, it's used as the value. Otherwise, the original `subBlock.value` is used.

- `return subAcc`: Returns the `subAcc` object, which now contains the merged sub-block states for the current block.

- `acc[id] = { ...block, subBlocks: mergedSubBlocks, }`: This line creates a new block object with the merged sub-block states and adds it to the `acc` accumulator.
    - `...block`: Creates a shallow copy of the original `block` object.
    - `subBlocks: mergedSubBlocks`: Assigns the `mergedSubBlocks` object (which contains the merged sub-block states) to the `subBlocks` property of the new block object.

-  The next block of code handles orphaned values.
    - `Object.entries(blockValues).forEach(([subBlockId, value]) => { ... })`: Iterates over the key-value pairs in the `blockValues` object.
    - `if (!mergedSubBlocks[subBlockId] && value !== null && value !== undefined) { ... }`:  Checks if a value exists in the store for a `subBlockId` but there's no corresponding sub-block in the `mergedSubBlocks` object (meaning it's an orphaned value).
    - `mergedSubBlocks[subBlockId] = { id: subBlockId, type: 'short-input', value: value, }`: If it's an orphaned value, this creates a minimal sub-block object with the `id`, a default `type` of `'short-input'`, and the `value` from the store, and adds it to the `mergedSubBlocks` object.

- `acc[id] = { ...block, subBlocks: mergedSubBlocks, }`:  Updates the block in the accumulator with the final merged subBlocks (including orphaned values).

- `return acc`: Returns the updated accumulator.

- `}, {} as Record<string, BlockState>)`:  This is the second argument to the `reduce` function, which specifies the initial value of the accumulator. In this case, it's an empty object of type `Record<string, BlockState>`.

**In Summary:**

The `mergeSubblockState` function efficiently merges sub-block values from a store into a set of workflow blocks. It handles optional workflow and block IDs, deals with potentially missing sub-block configurations, and includes orphaned values, ensuring a comprehensive and robust merging process. The nested `reduce` operations allow it to iterate through both blocks and their sub-blocks in a structured manner.

**Purpose:** This function is an asynchronous version of `mergeSubblockState`.  It merges workflow block states with sub-block values from the store, similar to the synchronous version, but leverages `Promise.all` to process blocks and their sub-blocks in parallel, potentially improving performance.  It returns a Promise that resolves to the merged block states.

**Line-by-line explanation:**

- `export async function mergeSubblockStateAsync( blocks: Record<string, BlockState>, workflowId?: string, blockId?: string ): Promise<Record<string, BlockState>> {`: Defines the asynchronous function signature.
    - `export`:  Makes the function available for use in other modules.
    - `async function mergeSubblockStateAsync`: Declares an asynchronous function named `mergeSubblockStateAsync`. The `async` keyword allows the use of `await` inside the function.
    - `(blocks: Record<string, BlockState>, workflowId?: string, blockId?: string)`: Specifies the function's arguments, identical to `mergeSubblockState`.
    - `: Promise<Record<string, BlockState>>`: Indicates that the function returns a `Promise` that will resolve to a record (object) where the keys are block IDs and the values are the merged `BlockState` objects.

- `const blocksToProcess = blockId ? { [blockId]: blocks[blockId] } : blocks`: Same as in `mergeSubblockState`, this line determines which blocks to process based on the `blockId` argument.

- `const subBlockStore = useSubBlockStore.getState()`: Same as in `mergeSubblockState`, this line retrieves the current state of the sub-block store.

- `const processedBlockEntries = await Promise.all( Object.entries(blocksToProcess).map(async ([id, block]) => { ... }) )`:  This line is the core of the asynchronous processing.
    - `Object.entries(blocksToProcess)`: Converts the `blocksToProcess` object into an array of key-value pairs (arrays of `[key, value]`).
    - `.map(async ([id, block]) => { ... })`: Maps over each block to transform them.  The `async` keyword indicates that the callback function returns a Promise.
        - `[id, block]`:  Destructuring assignment that extracts the block ID (`id`) and the `BlockState` object (`block`).
        - `=> { ... }`:  The asynchronous callback function.  This is where the logic for merging the sub-block state is performed for each block.
    - `Promise.all(...)`:  `Promise.all` takes an array of Promises and returns a single Promise that resolves when all of the input Promises have resolved. The resolved value is an array containing the resolved values of each input Promise in the same order. This allows all the blocks to be processed in parallel.
    - `await`: The `await` keyword pauses the execution of the `mergeSubblockStateAsync` function until the `Promise.all` has resolved.

- `if (!block || !block.subBlocks) { return [id, block] as const }`:  This line checks if the current `block` is undefined or doesn't have a `subBlocks` property.  If either is true, it returns the block as is, wrapped in a tuple with the `id`, and marked as a const assertion.  This prevents processing of blocks without subblocks.

- `const subBlockEntries = await Promise.all( Object.entries(block.subBlocks).map(async ([subBlockId, subBlock]) => { ... }) )`: This line processes the sub-blocks of the current block in parallel.
    - `Object.entries(block.subBlocks)`: Converts the `block.subBlocks` object into an array of key-value pairs (arrays of `[key, value]`).
    - `.map(async ([subBlockId, subBlock]) => { ... })`: Maps over each subblock to transform them.  The `async` keyword indicates that the callback function returns a Promise.
        - `[subBlockId, subBlock]`:  Destructuring assignment that extracts the sub-block ID (`subBlockId`) and the `SubBlockState` object (`subBlock`).
        - `=> { ... }`: The asynchronous callback function.
    - `Promise.all(...)`:  `Promise.all` ensures that all sub-blocks are processed in parallel.
    - `await`: The `await` keyword pauses execution until the `Promise.all` for the subblocks has resolved.

- `if (!subBlock) { return [subBlockId, subBlock] as const }`:  This line checks if the current `subBlock` is undefined. If it is, it returns the subBlock without processing.

- The next block of code retrieves stored value.
    - `let storedValue = null`: Sets `storedValue` to `null`.
    - `if (workflowId) { ... } else { ... }`:  conditional statement to branch the logic based on `workflowId`
        - `if (workflowId) { const workflowValues = subBlockStore.workflowValues[workflowId] if (workflowValues?.[id]) {storedValue = workflowValues[id][subBlockId]} }` checks for `workflowId`, then attempts to access the value for a given `subBlockId` using optional chaining. If present it sets the `storedValue`.
        - `else { storedValue = subBlockStore.getValue(id, subBlockId) }`:  If there's no `workflowId` use the `getValue` method to retrieve the value for the given `id` and `subBlockId`.

- `return [ subBlockId, { ...subBlock, value: storedValue !== undefined && storedValue !== null ? storedValue : subBlock.value, }, ] as const`:  This line creates a new sub-block object with the merged state. The logic is the same as the synchronous version. Returns a tuple with the subBlockId and modified subBlock with a const assertion.

- `const mergedSubBlocks = Object.fromEntries(subBlockEntries) as Record<string, SubBlockState>`:  Converts the array of `subBlockEntries` (which are tuples of `[subBlockId, subBlock]`) back into an object where the keys are the sub-block IDs and the values are the updated `SubBlockState` objects.

- `return [ id, { ...block, subBlocks: mergedSubBlocks, }, ] as const`:  This line returns the full block state with updated subBlocks, as a tuple with the `id`.

- `return Object.fromEntries(processedBlockEntries) as Record<string, BlockState>`:  Converts the array of processed block entries back into an object (a record) where the keys are block IDs and the values are the merged `BlockState` objects. The result is cast to `Record<string, BlockState>`.

**In Summary:**

The `mergeSubblockStateAsync` function provides a performant way to merge sub-block states by processing blocks and their sub-blocks concurrently. This function is particularly useful when dealing with large workflows or complex block configurations, as it can significantly reduce the time required to update the block
