### Purpose of this file:

This TypeScript file, `environment.ts`, provides utility functions for managing environment variables within an application, focusing on both personal (user-specific) and workspace-level environments. It includes functions for:

1.  **Retrieving environment variable keys:**  Getting the names of the environment variables without exposing their values.
2.  **Fetching and decrypting environment variables:** Obtaining both personal and workspace environment variables, decrypting their values, and identifying potential conflicts.
3.  **Combining environment variables:** Merging the decrypted personal and workspace environments into a single, effective environment.

These functions interact with a database (likely PostgreSQL, based on `drizzle-orm`) to store and retrieve encrypted environment variables.  It also incorporates logging and error handling.

### Detailed Explanation:

**1. Imports:**

```typescript
import { db } from '@sim/db'
import { environment, workspaceEnvironment } from '@sim/db/schema'
import { eq } from 'drizzle-orm'
import { createLogger } from '@/lib/logs/console/logger'
import { decryptSecret } from '@/lib/utils'
```

*   `db from '@sim/db'`:  Imports the database instance, presumably configured and exported from the `@sim/db` module.  This is used to interact with the database.
*   `environment, workspaceEnvironment from '@sim/db/schema'`: Imports the database schema definitions for the `environment` and `workspaceEnvironment` tables. These are likely Drizzle ORM schema objects.  `environment` probably stores user-specific environment variables, and `workspaceEnvironment` stores environment variables specific to a workspace.
*   `eq from 'drizzle-orm'`: Imports the `eq` (equals) function from the Drizzle ORM library.  This function is used to create `WHERE` clause conditions in database queries.
*   `createLogger from '@/lib/logs/console/logger'`: Imports a function to create a logger instance. This is used for logging errors and debugging information.  The path `@/lib/logs/console/logger` suggests a custom logger implementation.
*   `decryptSecret from '@/lib/utils'`: Imports a function to decrypt an encrypted secret (presumably an environment variable value).  This function is crucial for accessing the actual values of the environment variables.

**2. Logger Initialization:**

```typescript
const logger = createLogger('EnvironmentUtils')
```

*   Creates a logger instance named 'EnvironmentUtils'.  This allows for easy filtering and identification of log messages originating from this file.

**3. `getEnvironmentVariableKeys` Function:**

```typescript
/**
 * Get environment variable keys for a user
 * Returns only the variable names, not their values
 */
export async function getEnvironmentVariableKeys(userId: string): Promise<{
  variableNames: string[]
  count: number
}> {
  try {
    const result = await db
      .select()
      .from(environment)
      .where(eq(environment.userId, userId))
      .limit(1)

    if (!result.length || !result[0].variables) {
      return {
        variableNames: [],
        count: 0,
      }
    }

    // Get the keys (variable names) without decrypting values
    const encryptedVariables = result[0].variables as Record<string, string>
    const variableNames = Object.keys(encryptedVariables)

    return {
      variableNames,
      count: variableNames.length,
    }
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Error getting environment variable keys:', error)
    throw new Error('Failed to get environment variables')
  }
}
```

*   **Purpose:** This function retrieves the *names* (keys) of environment variables associated with a specific user, without exposing their actual, decrypted values.  This can be useful for displaying a list of available environment variables to the user or for other administrative purposes.
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `userId: string`: The ID of the user whose environment variable keys are to be retrieved.
*   **Return Value:**
    *   `Promise<{ variableNames: string[]; count: number }>`: A promise that resolves to an object containing:
        *   `variableNames: string[]`: An array of strings, where each string is the name of an environment variable.
        *   `count: number`: The total number of environment variables for the user.
*   **Implementation:**
    1.  **Database Query:**
        ```typescript
        const result = await db
          .select()
          .from(environment)
          .where(eq(environment.userId, userId))
          .limit(1)
        ```
        *   This query selects all columns (`.select()`) from the `environment` table.
        *   It filters the results using `.where(eq(environment.userId, userId))` to only include rows where the `userId` column matches the provided `userId`.  The `eq` function is from Drizzle ORM and ensures proper SQL equality comparison.
        *   `.limit(1)` limits the result set to a single row. This assumes each user has at most one row in the `environment` table for their variables.
    2.  **Handle Empty Results:**
        ```typescript
        if (!result.length || !result[0].variables) {
          return {
            variableNames: [],
            count: 0,
          }
        }
        ```
        *   Checks if the query returned any results (`!result.length`) or if the `variables` column in the first result is empty or null (`!result[0].variables`).  If either is true, it means the user has no environment variables defined, so it returns an empty array and a count of 0.
    3.  **Extract Variable Names:**
        ```typescript
        const encryptedVariables = result[0].variables as Record<string, string>
        const variableNames = Object.keys(encryptedVariables)
        ```
        *   `result[0].variables as Record<string, string>`: Accesses the `variables` property of the first (and only) row returned from the database. It's cast to `Record<string, string>`, assuming the `variables` column stores a JSON object where both keys and values are strings. These values are expected to be encrypted.
        *   `Object.keys(encryptedVariables)`:  Extracts the keys (variable names) from the `encryptedVariables` object and returns them as an array of strings.
    4.  **Return Results:**
        ```typescript
        return {
          variableNames,
          count: variableNames.length,
        }
        ```
        *   Returns an object containing the array of `variableNames` and their `count`.
    5.  **Error Handling:**
        ```typescript
        } catch (error) {
          logger.error('Error getting environment variable keys:', error)
          throw new Error('Failed to get environment variables')
        }
        ```
        *   If any error occurs during the process (e.g., database connection error), it logs the error using the `logger` and then throws a new error to indicate that the operation failed.

**4. `getPersonalAndWorkspaceEnv` Function:**

```typescript
export async function getPersonalAndWorkspaceEnv(
  userId: string,
  workspaceId?: string
): Promise<{
  personalEncrypted: Record<string, string>
  workspaceEncrypted: Record<string, string>
  personalDecrypted: Record<string, string>
  workspaceDecrypted: Record<string, string>
  conflicts: string[]
}> {
  const [personalRows, workspaceRows] = await Promise.all([
    db.select().from(environment).where(eq(environment.userId, userId)).limit(1),
    workspaceId
      ? db
          .select()
          .from(workspaceEnvironment)
          .where(eq(workspaceEnvironment.workspaceId, workspaceId))
          .limit(1)
      : Promise.resolve([] as any[]),
  ])

  const personalEncrypted: Record<string, string> = (personalRows[0]?.variables as any) || {}
  const workspaceEncrypted: Record<string, string> = (workspaceRows[0]?.variables as any) || {}

  const decryptAll = async (src: Record<string, string>) => {
    const out: Record<string, string> = {}
    for (const [k, v] of Object.entries(src)) {
      try {
        const { decrypted } = await decryptSecret(v)
        out[k] = decrypted
      } catch {
        out[k] = ''
      }
    }
    return out
  }

  const [personalDecrypted, workspaceDecrypted] = await Promise.all([
    decryptAll(personalEncrypted),
    decryptAll(workspaceEncrypted),
  ])

  const conflicts = Object.keys(personalEncrypted).filter((k) => k in workspaceEncrypted)

  return {
    personalEncrypted,
    workspaceEncrypted,
    personalDecrypted,
    workspaceDecrypted,
    conflicts,
  }
}
```

*   **Purpose:** This function retrieves and decrypts both personal and workspace environment variables for a given user and workspace (if provided). It identifies conflicts where the same variable name exists in both personal and workspace environments.
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `userId: string`: The ID of the user.
    *   `workspaceId?: string`: (Optional) The ID of the workspace. If provided, workspace environment variables are also retrieved.
*   **Return Value:**
    *   `Promise<{ personalEncrypted: Record<string, string>; workspaceEncrypted: Record<string, string>; personalDecrypted: Record<string, string>; workspaceDecrypted: Record<string, string>; conflicts: string[] }>`: A promise that resolves to an object containing:
        *   `personalEncrypted`: An object containing the user's encrypted environment variables (key-value pairs).
        *   `workspaceEncrypted`: An object containing the workspace's encrypted environment variables (key-value pairs).
        *   `personalDecrypted`: An object containing the user's *decrypted* environment variables (key-value pairs).
        *   `workspaceDecrypted`: An object containing the workspace's *decrypted* environment variables (key-value pairs).
        *   `conflicts`: An array of strings representing the names of environment variables that exist in *both* the personal and workspace environments.
*   **Implementation:**
    1.  **Fetch Personal and Workspace Variables (in parallel):**
        ```typescript
        const [personalRows, workspaceRows] = await Promise.all([
          db.select().from(environment).where(eq(environment.userId, userId)).limit(1),
          workspaceId
            ? db
                .select()
                .from(workspaceEnvironment)
                .where(eq(workspaceEnvironment.workspaceId, workspaceId))
                .limit(1)
            : Promise.resolve([] as any[]),
        ])
        ```
        *   Uses `Promise.all` to execute two database queries concurrently. This improves performance.
        *   The first query retrieves the user's personal environment variables from the `environment` table, similar to the `getEnvironmentVariableKeys` function.
        *   The second query retrieves the workspace environment variables from the `workspaceEnvironment` table.  It only executes if `workspaceId` is provided. If `workspaceId` is not provided, it resolves to an empty array immediately, avoiding an unnecessary database query.
    2.  **Extract Encrypted Variables:**
        ```typescript
        const personalEncrypted: Record<string, string> = (personalRows[0]?.variables as any) || {}
        const workspaceEncrypted: Record<string, string> = (workspaceRows[0]?.variables as any) || {}
        ```
        *   Extracts the `variables` from the database results.  It handles cases where no variables are found by providing a default empty object (`{}`).  The `as any` cast is used because the exact type of `variables` is not known at compile time.  Consider refining the schema definition to avoid this cast.
    3.  **`decryptAll` Function:**
        ```typescript
        const decryptAll = async (src: Record<string, string>) => {
          const out: Record<string, string> = {}
          for (const [k, v] of Object.entries(src)) {
            try {
              const { decrypted } = await decryptSecret(v)
              out[k] = decrypted
            } catch {
              out[k] = ''
            }
          }
          return out
        }
        ```
        *   This is a helper function to decrypt all the environment variables from a given source.
        *   It takes a record of encrypted key/value pairs (`src: Record<string, string>`).
        *   It iterates through each key-value pair in the source record.
        *   For each value, it attempts to decrypt it using the `decryptSecret` function.
        *   If decryption is successful, it adds the decrypted value to the `out` record.
        *   If decryption fails (throws an error), it adds an empty string (`''`) to the `out` record for that key.  This is a form of error handling – it prevents the entire process from crashing if one decryption fails.  It might be better to log an error here instead.
        *   Finally, it returns the `out` record containing the decrypted (or empty) values.
    4.  **Decrypt Variables (in parallel):**
        ```typescript
        const [personalDecrypted, workspaceDecrypted] = await Promise.all([
          decryptAll(personalEncrypted),
          decryptAll(workspaceEncrypted),
        ])
        ```
        *   Uses `Promise.all` to concurrently decrypt the personal and workspace environment variables using the `decryptAll` function.
    5.  **Identify Conflicts:**
        ```typescript
        const conflicts = Object.keys(personalEncrypted).filter((k) => k in workspaceEncrypted)
        ```
        *   Identifies conflicts (environment variables that exist in both personal and workspace scopes).
        *   It gets all the keys (variable names) from the `personalEncrypted` object.
        *   It filters this list, keeping only the keys that also exist in the `workspaceEncrypted` object.  The `k in workspaceEncrypted` expression checks if the key `k` is present as a property in the `workspaceEncrypted` object.
    6.  **Return Results:**
        ```typescript
        return {
          personalEncrypted,
          workspaceEncrypted,
          personalDecrypted,
          workspaceDecrypted,
          conflicts,
        }
        ```
        *   Returns an object containing all the encrypted and decrypted environment variables, as well as the list of conflicting variables.

**5. `getEffectiveDecryptedEnv` Function:**

```typescript
export async function getEffectiveDecryptedEnv(
  userId: string,
  workspaceId?: string
): Promise<Record<string, string>> {
  const { personalDecrypted, workspaceDecrypted } = await getPersonalAndWorkspaceEnv(
    userId,
    workspaceId
  )
  return { ...personalDecrypted, ...workspaceDecrypted }
}
```

*   **Purpose:** This function retrieves the *effective* decrypted environment, which is a combination of the user's personal environment variables and the workspace environment variables (if a workspace is specified).  Workspace variables take precedence over personal variables if there are conflicts.
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `userId: string`: The ID of the user.
    *   `workspaceId?: string`: (Optional) The ID of the workspace.
*   **Return Value:**
    *   `Promise<Record<string, string>>`: A promise that resolves to an object containing the combined decrypted environment variables.  If a variable exists in both the personal and workspace environments, the value from the workspace environment will be used.
*   **Implementation:**
    1.  **Get Personal and Workspace Environments:**
        ```typescript
        const { personalDecrypted, workspaceDecrypted } = await getPersonalAndWorkspaceEnv(
          userId,
          workspaceId
        )
        ```
        *   Calls the `getPersonalAndWorkspaceEnv` function to retrieve the decrypted personal and workspace environment variables.
    2.  **Merge Environments:**
        ```typescript
        return { ...personalDecrypted, ...workspaceDecrypted }
        ```
        *   Uses the spread syntax (`...`) to merge the `personalDecrypted` and `workspaceDecrypted` objects into a single object.  The `workspaceDecrypted` object is placed *after* the `personalDecrypted` object, so if there are any conflicting variable names (keys), the values from `workspaceDecrypted` will overwrite the values from `personalDecrypted`.  This ensures that workspace environment variables take precedence.

### Summary and Key Considerations:

*   **Security:** This code deals with sensitive information (environment variables). Ensure the `decryptSecret` function and the encryption mechanism used are robust and secure.  Proper key management is crucial.
*   **Error Handling:**  The `decryptAll` function uses a try-catch block but simply assigns an empty string in case of decryption failure.  Consider logging the error and potentially providing a more informative error message to the user.  Also, global try-catch block is missing in `getPersonalAndWorkspaceEnv` and `getEffectiveDecryptedEnv`.
*   **Type Safety:**  The `as any` casts used in the code indicate potential type safety issues.  Review the schema definitions for the `environment` and `workspaceEnvironment` tables and update the TypeScript types accordingly to avoid these casts.
*   **Database Interactions:** The code assumes that the database connection and queries are handled correctly by the `db` instance and the Drizzle ORM library.  Monitor database performance and optimize queries as needed.
*   **Scalability:** If the number of environment variables per user or workspace is very large, consider optimizing the database queries and decryption process to ensure scalability.
*   **Workspace Resolution:** The code assumes a simple model where a user is associated with a single personal environment and potentially a single workspace environment.  In more complex scenarios, you might need to handle multiple workspaces or a more sophisticated environment inheritance model.
*   **Alternatives to Empty String on Decryption Error:** Returning an empty string (`''`) when decryption fails might not be the best approach.  Consider:
    *   Returning `null` or `undefined`.
    *   Throwing an exception.
    *   Returning a special object like `{ error: 'Decryption failed' }`.
*   **Data Validation:** It's good practice to validate the structure and content of the environment variables before storing them in the database. This can help prevent errors and inconsistencies.
*   **Drizzle ORM Version:** Be aware of the specific version of Drizzle ORM being used, as the API might change in future versions.

This analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the code's functionality, purpose, and potential areas for improvement. Remember to prioritize security and maintainability when working with sensitive data like environment variables.
