/**
 * Purpose of this file:
 *
 * This file defines a constant array named `SSO_TRUSTED_PROVIDERS`.  This array holds a list of strings, where each string represents a known and trusted Single Sign-On (SSO) provider.
 * The purpose of this list is to provide a central, easily maintainable registry of recognized SSO providers.  This list can be used for various purposes within an application, such as:
 *
 * 1.  **Validation:** To validate user-provided or configuration-based SSO provider names against this list, ensuring that the application only trusts legitimate and pre-approved SSO services.  This helps prevent security vulnerabilities arising from accepting arbitrary SSO provider configurations.
 * 2.  **Feature Flags/Logic:**  To conditionally enable or disable certain features or functionalities based on the detected SSO provider.  For example, different SSO providers might require different authentication flows or data mapping strategies.
 * 3.  **User Interface (UI):** To provide a predefined list of SSO providers in a dropdown or selection component in the UI, improving the user experience and ensuring consistency.
 * 4.  **Reporting/Analytics:**  To categorize and analyze user logins based on the SSO provider they used.
 *
 * Simplification of Complex Logic:
 *
 * This array simplifies complex logic by abstracting away the specific knowledge of what constitutes a "trusted" SSO provider.  Instead of scattering hardcoded provider names throughout the codebase, this single source of truth ensures consistency and reduces the risk of errors.  When a new SSO provider needs to be supported, or an existing one needs to be deprecated, only this array needs to be modified, rather than potentially many different locations in the code.  This improves maintainability and reduces the likelihood of introducing bugs during updates.

**Line-by-Line Explanation:**

1.  `/**`:  This initiates a JSDoc-style multi-line comment.  This type of comment is used to provide documentation for the code.  Tools like TypeScript's compiler and documentation generators (e.g., JSDoc, TypeDoc) can parse these comments to generate API documentation.

2.  `* Purpose of this file:` through `* Code Explanation:`: These lines are part of the JSDoc comment, explaining the purpose, simplification, and providing a header for the subsequent code explanation.

3.  `*/`:  This terminates the JSDoc-style multi-line comment.

4.  `export const SSO_TRUSTED_PROVIDERS = [`:
    *   `export`: This keyword makes the `SSO_TRUSTED_PROVIDERS` constant accessible from other modules (files) in the project.  Without `export`, the constant would only be visible within the current file.
    *   `const`: This declares a constant variable. This means that the value assigned to `SSO_TRUSTED_PROVIDERS` (which is the array) cannot be reassigned.  However, the *contents* of the array itself can still be modified (unless the array were also made immutable using other techniques).
    *   `SSO_TRUSTED_PROVIDERS`: This is the name of the constant variable. The convention of using all uppercase letters with underscores suggests that this is a constant value used application-wide.
    *   `= [`: This is the assignment operator. It assigns the array literal that follows to the `SSO_TRUSTED_PROVIDERS` constant.  The `[` character initiates the array literal.

5.  ` 'okta',`: This is the first element of the array, a string literal representing the SSO provider "okta".  The comma `,` separates it from the next element in the array.

6.  `'okta-saml',`: A string literal representing "okta-saml", likely a variant or configuration related to Okta using SAML.
