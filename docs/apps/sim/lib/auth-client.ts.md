This file is a central configuration hub for authentication and related services in a React application, likely using the `better-auth` library. It sets up a robust authentication client (`client`) by integrating various plugins for different authentication methods (email OTP, OAuth, SSO, custom sessions) and also incorporates billing functionalities via Stripe.

Beyond just setting up the client, it exports several convenient React hooks (`useSession`, `useActiveOrganization`, `useSubscription`) and core authentication functions (`signIn`, `signUp`, `signOut`) to be used throughout the application. This makes it easy for other parts of the app to interact with the authentication system and associated features without needing to know the complex underlying setup.

In essence, this file acts as the **single source of truth for your application's authentication and user-related services**.

### Simplified Breakdown of Complex Logic

The most "complex" part of this file is the `plugins` array within `createAuthClient`. It uses conditional logic to include or exclude certain authentication and billing features based on environment variables or configuration flags.

**Simplified Explanation:**

Imagine you're building a car, and you have a list of optional features you can add (like a sunroof, a premium sound system, or GPS).

*   `createAuthClient` is like building the base car.
*   `plugins` is your list of optional features.
*   `emailOTPClient()`, `genericOAuthClient()`, `customSessionClient()`, `organizationClient()` are features that are **always included** in this car build.
*   `...(isBillingEnabled ? [stripeClient(...)] : [])` is like saying: "If the `isBillingEnabled` flag is ON, then add the `stripeClient` feature (our premium sound system). Otherwise, don't add it."
*   `...(env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SSO_ENABLED ? [ssoClient()] : [])` is similar: "If the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SSO_ENABLED` flag is ON in our environment settings, then add the `ssoClient` feature (our GPS system). Otherwise, don't add it."

This conditional approach ensures that your application only loads and uses the necessary code for features you actually want to enable, leading to a leaner and more efficient build.

### Line-by-Line Explanation

Let's go through the code step-by-step:

#### 1. Imports

```typescript
import { useContext } from 'react'
```
*   **Purpose:** Imports the `useContext` hook from React. This hook allows functional components to subscribe to React Context changes.
*   **Explanation:** We'll use this later to access shared session data stored in a `SessionContext`.

```typescript
import { ssoClient } from '@better-auth/sso/client'
import { stripeClient } from '@better-auth/stripe/client'
import {
  customSessionClient,
  emailOTPClient,
  genericOAuthClient,
  organizationClient,
} from 'better-auth/client/plugins'
```
*   **Purpose:** These lines import various "plugins" provided by the `better-auth` library.
*   **Explanation:**
    *   `ssoClient`: A plugin to enable Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities.
    *   `stripeClient`: A plugin to integrate with Stripe for billing and subscription management.
    *   `customSessionClient`: A plugin for handling custom session logic, allowing the application to define its own session structure.
    *   `emailOTPClient`: A plugin for authentication using Email One-Time Passwords.
    *   `genericOAuthClient`: A plugin to support general OAuth providers (like Google, GitHub, etc.).
    *   `organizationClient`: A plugin for managing organizations or multi-tenancy within the application.
*   **Overall:** These plugins extend the core `better-auth` client with specific functionalities.

```typescript
import { createAuthClient } from 'better-auth/react'
```
*   **Purpose:** Imports the main function to initialize the authentication client.
*   **Explanation:** `createAuthClient` is a utility from `better-auth/react` that sets up and configures the core authentication client for use within a React application.

```typescript
import type { auth } from '@/lib/auth'
```
*   **Purpose:** Imports a TypeScript type definition.
*   **Explanation:** This line imports the `auth` type from a local path (`@/lib/auth`). This type likely defines the structure of the custom session data as expected by your backend. It's used to ensure type safety when configuring `customSessionClient`.

```typescript
import { env } from '@/lib/env'
```
*   **Purpose:** Imports environment variables.
*   **Explanation:** This allows the code to access configuration values specific to the deployment environment (e.g., development, production). It's typically used for conditional logic, as seen later with `env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SSO_ENABLED`.

```typescript
import { isBillingEnabled } from '@/lib/environment'
```
*   **Purpose:** Imports a configuration flag indicating whether billing features are enabled.
*   **Explanation:** This boolean variable, likely defined in a local environment configuration file, will be used to conditionally include the Stripe billing plugin.

```typescript
import { SessionContext, type SessionHookResult } from '@/lib/session/session-context'
```
*   **Purpose:** Imports a React Context and its associated type.
*   **Explanation:**
    *   `SessionContext`: This is a React Context object that provides session-related data to all components wrapped by its Provider.
    *   `type SessionHookResult`: This is the TypeScript type that defines the shape of the data returned by the `useSession` hook.

```typescript
import { getBaseUrl } from '@/lib/urls/utils'
```
*   **Purpose:** Imports a utility function for retrieving the application's base URL.
*   **Explanation:** `getBaseUrl()` will return the root URL of your application (e.g., `https://your-app.com`). This is crucial for the authentication client to know where to send its requests.

#### 2. Authentication Client Configuration

```typescript
export const client = createAuthClient({
  baseURL: getBaseUrl(),
  plugins: [
    emailOTPClient(),
    genericOAuthClient(),
    customSessionClient<typeof auth>(),
    ...(isBillingEnabled
      ? [
          stripeClient({
            subscription: true, // Enable subscription management
          }),
        ]
      : []),
    organizationClient(),
    ...(env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SSO_ENABLED ? [ssoClient()] : []),
  ],
})
```
*   **Purpose:** This is the core setup for your application's authentication client.
*   **Explanation:**
    *   `export const client = ...`: Defines and exports a constant named `client`. This `client` object will contain all the authentication functionalities and services.
    *   `createAuthClient({...})`: Calls the `createAuthClient` function to initialize the client, passing a configuration object.
    *   `baseURL: getBaseUrl()`: Sets the base URL for all API requests made by this client. This ensures the client knows where your backend authentication service is located.
    *   `plugins: [...]`: An array that specifies which `better-auth` plugins to include. Each plugin adds specific features:
        *   `emailOTPClient()`: Enables email-based One-Time Password authentication.
        *   `genericOAuthClient()`: Enables authentication through generic OAuth providers (e.g., Google, GitHub, etc.).
        *   `customSessionClient<typeof auth>()`: Enables custom session management. The `<typeof auth>` part is a TypeScript generic that tells the `customSessionClient` what the expected type of the session object is, ensuring type safety.
        *   `...(isBillingEnabled ? [stripeClient({ subscription: true })] : [])`: This is a conditional spread operator.
            *   `isBillingEnabled ? [...] : []`: It checks if `isBillingEnabled` is `true`.
            *   If `true`, it includes `[stripeClient({ subscription: true })]` in the `plugins` array. This adds the Stripe integration, with `subscription: true` specifically enabling subscription management features.
            *   If `false`, it adds an empty array `[]`, effectively including nothing, so Stripe features are not bundled.
        *   `organizationClient()`: Enables features related to managing organizations or multi-tenancy.
        *   `...(env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SSO_ENABLED ? [ssoClient()] : [])`: Another conditional spread operator.
            *   `env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SSO_ENABLED ? [...] : []`: It checks if the environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_SSO_ENABLED` is `true`.
            *   If `true`, it includes `[ssoClient()]`, enabling Single Sign-On features.
            *   If `false`, it includes nothing.

#### 3. `useSession` Hook

```typescript
export function useSession(): SessionHookResult {
  const ctx = useContext(SessionContext)
  if (!ctx) {
    throw new Error(
      'SessionProvider is not mounted. Wrap your app with <SessionProvider> in app/layout.tsx.'
    )
  }
  return ctx
}
```
*   **Purpose:** Provides a convenient and type-safe way for React components to access the current user session data.
*   **Explanation:**
    *   `export function useSession(): SessionHookResult { ... }`: Defines and exports a custom React hook called `useSession`. It explicitly states that this hook will return data of type `SessionHookResult`.
    *   `const ctx = useContext(SessionContext)`: Uses the `useContext` React hook to attempt to retrieve the value from the `SessionContext`. This `ctx` variable will hold the current session data (or `null`/`undefined` if no provider is found).
    *   `if (!ctx) { ... }`: This is crucial error handling. If `ctx` is `null` or `undefined`, it means that the `SessionContext` was not provided higher up in the component tree.
    *   `throw new Error(...)`: If the context is missing, an error is thrown, providing a helpful message instructing the developer to wrap their application with `<SessionProvider>`.
    *   `return ctx`: If the context is found, its value (the session data) is returned by the hook.

#### 4. `useActiveOrganization` Export

```typescript
export const { useActiveOrganization } = client
```
*   **Purpose:** Exports a specific hook directly from the `client` object.
*   **Explanation:** This line uses JavaScript object destructuring. It takes the `useActiveOrganization` property directly from the `client` object and exports it as a named constant. This hook, provided by the `organizationClient` plugin, allows components to easily access information about the currently active organization.

#### 5. `useSubscription` Hook

```typescript
export const useSubscription = () => {
  return {
    list: client.subscription?.list,
    upgrade: client.subscription?.upgrade,
    cancel: client.subscription?.cancel,
    restore: client.subscription?.restore,
  }
}
```
*   **Purpose:** Provides access to various subscription management functions.
*   **Explanation:**
    *   `export const useSubscription = () => { ... }`: Defines and exports a custom hook called `useSubscription`.
    *   `return { ... }`: The hook returns an object containing several functions related to subscriptions.
    *   `client.subscription?.list`, `client.subscription?.upgrade`, etc.: These lines access properties (functions) from the `subscription` object, which is part of the `client`. The `?.` is the **optional chaining** operator. It's used here because the `subscription` object will only exist on the `client` if the `stripeClient` plugin was included (i.e., `isBillingEnabled` was `true`). If `client.subscription` is `undefined`, optional chaining ensures the expression evaluates to `undefined` instead of throwing an error, making the hook resilient.
    *   These functions (e.g., `list`, `upgrade`, `cancel`, `restore`) are the API calls to manage user subscriptions via Stripe.

#### 6. Core Authentication Functions

```typescript
export const { signIn, signUp, signOut } = client
```
*   **Purpose:** Exports the fundamental authentication functions directly from the `client` object.
*   **Explanation:** Similar to `useActiveOrganization`, this line uses object destructuring to extract and export `signIn`, `signUp`, and `signOut` functions from the `client` object. These are the primary methods for users to log in, register, and log out of the application.
