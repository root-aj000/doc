**Explanation and Simplification:**

**Purpose of this file:**

This TypeScript file acts as a central repository for configuration settings related to the Sim Agent API.  Specifically, it stores the default API URL and the version number of the Sim Agent. This approach is good practice for the following reasons:

*   **Maintainability:**  If the API URL or version number changes, you only need to update it in this one file, rather than searching through the entire codebase.
*   **Consistency:**  Using constants ensures that the same values are used consistently throughout the application, preventing errors caused by typos or different interpretations.
*   **Readability:** Using meaningful constant names (e.g., `SIM_AGENT_API_URL_DEFAULT`) improves the readability of the code.

**Simplified Explanation of each line:**

1.  `export const SIM_AGENT_API_URL_DEFAULT = 'https://copilot.sim.ai'`

    *   **`export`**: Makes the constant accessible from other TypeScript files.
    *   **`const`**: Defines a constant variable whose value cannot be changed after initialization.
    *   **`SIM_AGENT_API_URL_DEFAULT`**:  The name of the constant that holds the API URL.  It clearly indicates that it's the *default* URL.
    *   **`'https://copilot.sim.ai'`**:  The actual default URL of the Sim Agent API.  This is a string literal.

2.  `export const SIM_AGENT_VERSION = '1.0.1'`

    *   **`export`**:  Makes the constant accessible from other TypeScript files.
    *   **`const`**: Defines a constant variable whose value cannot be changed.
    *   **`SIM_AGENT_VERSION`**: The name of the constant that stores the version number.
    *   **`'1.0.1'`**: The version number of the Sim Agent, represented as a string.

**How the code avoids complex logic:**

The code avoids complex logic by being simple and direct.  Instead of performing calculations or conditional checks, it simply declares and initializes two constants with their respective values. This straightforward approach makes the code easy to understand and maintain.  The complexity is pushed to the *usage* of these constants elsewhere in the application (e.g., using `SIM_AGENT_API_URL_DEFAULT` in an API client or `SIM_AGENT_VERSION` in an "About" section of the UI).
