This TypeScript file is a sophisticated module designed to manage the lifecycle and access of the **Stripe API client** within an application. Its primary goal is to ensure that a **single, secure, and correctly initialized** instance of the Stripe client is available throughout your application, only when needed, and only if the necessary environment variables are configured.

---

### **Purpose of This File**

In essence, this file acts as a **centralized gatekeeper** for your Stripe API interactions. Here's why it's crucial:

1.  **Singleton Pattern**: It guarantees that only one instance of the `Stripe` client is ever created. This saves resources, prevents potential conflicts, and ensures consistent configuration across your application.
2.  **Lazy Initialization**: The Stripe client is not created immediately when the file loads. Instead, it's created only when it's first requested (`lazily`), making your application startup faster if Stripe isn't immediately needed.
3.  **Secure Configuration**: It enforces the presence of `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` from environment variables, preventing the application from attempting Stripe operations without proper authentication.
4.  **Error Handling & Robustness**: It includes mechanisms to gracefully handle cases where Stripe credentials are missing or initialization fails, providing clear logging and controlled behavior.
5.  **Controlled Access**: It provides two distinct ways to access the client:
    *   One that returns `null` if Stripe isn't available (for optional Stripe features).
    *   One that throws an error if Stripe *must* be available (for core Stripe-dependent functionalities).
6.  **Logging**: Integrates a logger to provide visibility into the client's initialization status and potential issues.

### **Simplified Complex Logic: The Singleton Pattern with a Twist**

The core complexity lies in the `createStripeClientSingleton` function. This isn't just a simple function; it's a pattern designed to create and manage the single Stripe client instance.

Imagine you have a very important, expensive tool (the Stripe client) that only one person should use at a time, and it needs a specific key to operate.

1.  **The "Tool Manager" (`createStripeClientSingleton`)**: This function acts like a manager for this special tool. When you ask the manager to set up, it gives you a set of instructions on how to get the tool.
2.  **The Actual Tool Holder (`stripeClient`)**: Inside the manager's instructions, there's a designated spot (`stripeClient`) where the actual tool will be placed once it's created. Initially, this spot is empty (`null`).
3.  **The "Setting Up" Sign (`isInitializing`)**: The manager also has a little sign (`isInitializing`). When someone is currently setting up the tool, the sign says "In Progress." This prevents other people from trying to set it up at the exact same time, which could cause problems.
4.  **Getting the Tool (`getInstance`)**: This is the main instruction the manager gives you.
    *   **"Is the tool already here?"**: First, it checks the `stripeClient` spot. If the tool is already there, great! Hand it over.
    *   **"Is someone else setting it up?"**: If not, it checks the `isInitializing` sign. If it says "In Progress," it means someone else is busy, so just wait or try again later (or return `null` in this case).
    *   **"Do we have the key?"**: Before even trying to get the tool, it checks if you have the `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`. No key, no tool.
    *   **"Okay, let's set it up!"**: If none of the above, it flips the `isInitializing` sign to "In Progress," carefully creates the tool (`new Stripe(...)`), places it in the `stripeClient` spot, and then flips the `isInitializing` sign back to "Finished" (even if there was an error).
5.  **The Public Access Points (`getStripeClient`, `requireStripeClient`)**: These are like the public doors to the manager's office. You don't directly interact with the manager's internal setup; you just ask for the tool through these doors.

This setup ensures that no matter how many times or from how many different places your application tries to get the Stripe client, it will always receive the *same* instance, and that instance will only be created once, and only if all conditions are met.

### **Line-by-Line Explanation**

```typescript
import Stripe from 'stripe'
```
*   **`import Stripe from 'stripe'`**: This line imports the `Stripe` class (and its associated types) from the installed `stripe` Node.js library. This class is what you use to interact with the Stripe API.

```typescript
import { env } from '@/lib/env'
```
*   **`import { env } from '@/lib/env'`**: This imports an `env` object from a local utility file (`@/lib/env`). This `env` object is responsible for loading and providing access to environment variables (like `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`) in a structured and safe manner.

```typescript
import { createLogger } from '@/lib/logs/console/logger'
```
*   **`import { createLogger } from '@/lib/logs/console/logger'`**: This imports a `createLogger` function from a local logging utility. This function is used to create a logger instance specific to a particular module or context.

```typescript
const logger = createLogger('StripeClient')
```
*   **`const logger = createLogger('StripeClient')`**: This line creates a logger instance named `StripeClient`. Any log messages originating from this file will be tagged with `StripeClient`, making it easier to track and debug issues related to Stripe operations.

```typescript
/**
 * Check if Stripe credentials are valid
 */
export function hasValidStripeCredentials(): boolean {
  return !!env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
}
```
*   **`export function hasValidStripeCredentials(): boolean { ... }`**: This function checks if the essential Stripe credential, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, is available in the environment variables.
    *   **`!!env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`**: This double-negation (`!!`) is a common JavaScript idiom to explicitly convert any value into a boolean. If `env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is a non-empty string (truthy), it becomes `true`. If it's `null`, `undefined`, or an empty string (falsy), it becomes `false`. This function is crucial for preventing attempts to initialize Stripe without the necessary key.

```typescript
/**
 * Secure Stripe client singleton with initialization guard
 */
const createStripeClientSingleton = () => {
  let stripeClient: Stripe | null = null
  let isInitializing = false

  return {
    getInstance(): Stripe | null {
      // If already initialized, return immediately
      if (stripeClient) return stripeClient

      // Prevent concurrent initialization attempts
      if (isInitializing) {
        logger.debug('Stripe client initialization already in progress')
        return null
      }

      if (!hasValidStripeCredentials()) {
        logger.warn('Stripe credentials not available - Stripe operations will be disabled')
        return null
      }

      try {
        isInitializing = true

        stripeClient = new Stripe(env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY || '', {
          apiVersion: '2025-08-27.basil',
        })

        logger.info('Stripe client initialized successfully')
        return stripeClient
      } catch (error) {
        logger.error('Failed to initialize Stripe client', { error })
        stripeClient = null // Ensure cleanup on failure
        return null
      } finally {
        isInitializing = false
      }
    },

    // For testing purposes only - allows resetting the singleton
    reset(): void {
      stripeClient = null
      isInitializing = false
    },
  }
}
```
*   **`const createStripeClientSingleton = () => { ... }`**: This defines a function that, when called, creates an object containing methods to manage the Stripe client singleton. This function forms a **closure**, meaning the `stripeClient` and `isInitializing` variables are private to this scope and persist across calls to the returned methods.
    *   **`let stripeClient: Stripe | null = null`**: This declares a variable `stripeClient` which will hold the actual `Stripe` client instance once it's created. It's initialized to `null` because the client hasn't been created yet.
    *   **`let isInitializing = false`**: This boolean flag is a crucial part of the "initialization guard." It tracks whether the `Stripe` client is currently in the process of being initialized. This prevents multiple concurrent attempts to create the client, which could lead to race conditions or unnecessary work.
    *   **`return { ... }`**: The `createStripeClientSingleton` function returns an object with methods that can be called externally.
        *   **`getInstance(): Stripe | null { ... }`**: This is the core method for getting the Stripe client instance.
            *   **`if (stripeClient) return stripeClient`**: This is the primary check. If `stripeClient` already holds an instance (meaning it has been successfully initialized before), that instance is immediately returned. This ensures the singleton property: always return the same instance.
            *   **`if (isInitializing) { ... }`**: If `stripeClient` is `null` but `isInitializing` is `true`, it means another part of the application is already in the process of creating the client. To prevent redundant work or potential issues, it logs a debug message and returns `null`, indicating the client isn't ready yet.
            *   **`if (!hasValidStripeCredentials()) { ... }`**: Before attempting to create a new client, it calls `hasValidStripeCredentials()` to check if the `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is available. If not, it logs a warning and returns `null`, as Stripe operations cannot proceed without credentials.
            *   **`try { ... } catch (error) { ... } finally { ... }`**: This block handles the actual client creation and robust error management.
                *   **`isInitializing = true`**: Inside the `try` block, the `isInitializing` flag is set to `true` just before attempting to create the client.
                *   **`stripeClient = new Stripe(env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY || '', { ... })`**: This is where the `Stripe` client is instantiated.
                    *   `env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY || ''`: It uses the secret key from environment variables. The `|| ''` is a defensive fallback to an empty string, though `hasValidStripeCredentials` should ideally prevent this path if the key is truly missing.
                    *   `apiVersion: '2025-08-27.basil'` : Specifies the API version to use. This is crucial for Stripe integrations, as it ensures your code interacts with a consistent Stripe API behavior, even if Stripe releases breaking changes in newer versions. It locks your integration to a specific point in time.
                *   **`logger.info('Stripe client initialized successfully')`**: If client creation succeeds, a success message is logged.
                *   **`return stripeClient`**: The newly created `Stripe` client instance is returned.
                *   **`catch (error) { ... }`**: If an error occurs during `new Stripe()`, this block catches it.
                    *   `logger.error('Failed to initialize Stripe client', { error })`: An error message and the error object itself are logged.
                    *   `stripeClient = null`: It's good practice to reset `stripeClient` to `null` on failure, ensuring that subsequent calls will attempt re-initialization (or return null) rather than returning a potentially malformed or partially initialized client.
                    *   `return null`: `null` is returned to signal that the client could not be initialized.
                *   **`finally { isInitializing = false }`**: The `finally` block *always* executes, whether the `try` block succeeded or `catch` block ran. This ensures that the `isInitializing` flag is reset to `false`, allowing future attempts to initialize if the previous one failed or to simply return the client if it succeeded.
        *   **`reset(): void { ... }`**: This method is primarily for testing purposes.
            *   **`stripeClient = null`**: Resets the stored client instance to `null`.
            *   **`isInitializing = false`**: Resets the initialization flag. This allows tests to "clean up" the singleton state between test runs, ensuring each test starts with a fresh, uninitialized client.

```typescript
const stripeClientSingleton = createStripeClientSingleton()
```
*   **`const stripeClientSingleton = createStripeClientSingleton()`**: This line calls the `createStripeClientSingleton()` function *once*. The object returned by this function (containing `getInstance` and `reset` methods) is stored in the `stripeClientSingleton` constant. This constant is now the central manager for our Stripe client throughout the application.

```typescript
/**
 * Get the Stripe client instance
 * @returns Stripe client or null if credentials are not available
 */
export function getStripeClient(): Stripe | null {
  return stripeClientSingleton.getInstance()
}
```
*   **`export function getStripeClient(): Stripe | null { ... }`**: This is a public function that provides the primary way to access the Stripe client.
    *   **`return stripeClientSingleton.getInstance()`**: It simply calls the `getInstance()` method on our `stripeClientSingleton` manager. This function will return either the `Stripe` client instance or `null` if it couldn't be initialized (due to missing credentials, errors, or being already in progress). This is suitable for situations where Stripe operations are optional.

```typescript
/**
 * Get the Stripe client instance, throwing an error if not available
 * Use this when Stripe operations are required
 */
export function requireStripeClient(): Stripe {
  const client = getStripeClient()

  if (!client) {
    throw new Error(
      'Stripe client is not available. Set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY in your environment variables.'
    )
  }

  return client
}
```
*   **`export function requireStripeClient(): Stripe { ... }`**: This is another public function for accessing the Stripe client, but with a stricter contract.
    *   **`const client = getStripeClient()`**: It first attempts to get the client using `getStripeClient()`.
    *   **`if (!client) { ... }`**: If `getStripeClient()` returns `null` (meaning the client isn't available), this condition is met.
    *   **`throw new Error(...)`**: Instead of returning `null`, it throws a descriptive `Error`. This is intended for parts of your application where Stripe functionality is absolutely essential. If the client isn't available, it signifies a critical configuration issue or a failure that the application cannot recover from gracefully, thus demanding immediate attention by crashing the operation.
    *   **`return client`**: If the client is successfully retrieved, it's returned.
