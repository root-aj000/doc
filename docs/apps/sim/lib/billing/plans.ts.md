This TypeScript file acts as a central configuration and utility hub for managing subscription billing plans within an application, likely integrating with a payment processor like Stripe. It defines the structure of different billing plans (Free, Pro, Team, Enterprise), retrieves their specific details (such as Stripe Price IDs and usage limits), and provides convenient functions to access this information by plan name.

### **Detailed Explanation**

#### **1. Imports: Bringing in External Tools**

```typescript
import {
  getFreeTierLimit,
  getProTierLimit,
  getTeamTierLimitPerSeat,
} from '@/lib/billing/subscriptions/utils'
import { env } from '@/lib/env'
```

*   **`getFreeTierLimit`, `getProTierLimit`, `getTeamTierLimitPerSeat`**: These functions are imported from a utility file (`@/lib/billing/subscriptions/utils`). They are responsible for providing the specific numerical limits for each subscription tier. For example, `getFreeTierLimit()` might return `100` (meaning 100 free users or 100 API calls), `getProTierLimit()` might return `1000`, and `getTeamTierLimitPerSeat()` might return a limit that applies per user in a team plan.
*   **`env`**: This object is imported from `@/lib/env` and provides access to environment variables. Environment variables are configuration values (like API keys, database URLs, etc.) that are set outside of the code itself, typically during deployment.

#### **2. Interface `BillingPlan`: Defining the Structure of a Plan**

```typescript
export interface BillingPlan {
  name: string
  priceId: string
  limits: {
    cost: number
  }
}
```

This code defines a blueprint (an `interface`) for what a "Billing Plan" object should look like. Any object that conforms to this `BillingPlan` interface must have:

*   **`name: string`**: A human-readable name for the plan (e.g., "free", "pro", "team").
*   **`priceId: string`**: A unique identifier for this plan in your payment processor (e.g., Stripe's Price ID). This ID is crucial for creating subscriptions.
*   **`limits: { cost: number }`**: An object containing various limits for the plan.
    *   **`cost: number`**: This might seem counter-intuitive, but in this context, `cost` likely refers to a *usage limit* or *allocation* rather than a monetary price. For example, it could mean the "cost" (in terms of resources consumed) allowed by the plan, like the maximum number of users, API requests, or storage units. This aligns with the imported `get...TierLimit` functions which typically return numerical usage thresholds.

#### **3. Function `getPlans()`: Listing All Available Billing Plans**

```typescript
/**
 * Get the billing plans configuration for Better Auth Stripe plugin
 */
export function getPlans(): BillingPlan[] {
  return [
    {
      name: 'free',
      priceId: env.STRIPE_FREE_PRICE_ID || '',
      limits: {
        cost: getFreeTierLimit(),
      },
    },
    {
      name: 'pro',
      priceId: env.STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID || '',
      limits: {
        cost: getProTierLimit(),
      },
    },
    {
      name: 'team',
      priceId: env.STRIPE_TEAM_PRICE_ID || '',
      limits: {
        cost: getTeamTierLimitPerSeat(),
      },
    },
    {
      name: 'enterprise',
      priceId: 'price_dynamic',
      limits: {
        cost: getTeamTierLimitPerSeat(), // Reuses team limit for enterprise as a placeholder or baseline
      },
    },
  ]
}
```

This function, `getPlans()`, is the core of this file. It returns an array of `BillingPlan` objects, each representing a different subscription tier.

*   **`export function getPlans(): BillingPlan[]`**: Declares a function named `getPlans` that can be used by other parts of the application. It explicitly states that it will return an array (`[]`) of `BillingPlan` objects.
*   **`return [...]`**: This line returns an array containing four `BillingPlan` objects, configured as follows:
    *   **`name: 'free'`**: The Free tier.
        *   **`priceId: env.STRIPE_FREE_PRICE_ID || ''`**: Its Stripe Price ID is pulled from an environment variable named `STRIPE_FREE_PRICE_ID`. If this environment variable is not set, it defaults to an empty string (`''`) to prevent errors.
        *   **`limits: { cost: getFreeTierLimit() }`**: Its usage limit is determined by calling the `getFreeTierLimit()` function imported earlier.
    *   **`name: 'pro'`**: The Pro tier.
        *   **`priceId: env.STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID || ''`**: Its Stripe Price ID is from `STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID` or defaults to `''`.
        *   **`limits: { cost: getProTierLimit() }`**: Its usage limit is determined by calling `getProTierLimit()`.
    *   **`name: 'team'`**: The Team tier.
        *   **`priceId: env.STRIPE_TEAM_PRICE_ID || ''`**: Its Stripe Price ID is from `STRIPE_TEAM_PRICE_ID` or defaults to `''`.
        *   **`limits: { cost: getTeamTierLimitPerSeat() }`**: Its usage limit is determined by calling `getTeamTierLimitPerSeat()`. This suggests a limit that scales per user or "seat" on the team plan.
    *   **`name: 'enterprise'`**: The Enterprise tier.
        *   **`priceId: 'price_dynamic'`**: Unlike other plans, this plan's `priceId` is hardcoded to `'price_dynamic'`. This usually indicates that Enterprise pricing is custom, negotiated, or handled outside of standard fixed Stripe products (e.g., a sales team quotes a price, and the Stripe subscription is created programmatically with a one-time or custom price).
        *   **`limits: { cost: getTeamTierLimitPerSeat() }`**: For its usage limit, it currently reuses `getTeamTierLimitPerSeat()`. This might be a placeholder, a default baseline, or it could mean that the *per-seat* model for limits also applies to enterprise, but the pricing is dynamic.

#### **4. Function `getPlanByName(planName: string)`: Finding a Specific Plan**

```typescript
/**
 * Get a specific plan by name
 */
export function getPlanByName(planName: string): BillingPlan | undefined {
  return getPlans().find((plan) => plan.name === planName)
}
```

This utility function makes it easy to retrieve a single billing plan based on its name.

*   **`export function getPlanByName(planName: string): BillingPlan | undefined`**: Declares a function `getPlanByName` that takes one argument, `planName` (a string). It will return either a `BillingPlan` object if found, or `undefined` if no plan with that name exists.
*   **`getPlans()`**: First, it calls the `getPlans()` function to retrieve the complete list of all configured billing plans.
*   **`.find((plan) => plan.name === planName)`**: It then uses the JavaScript array method `find()`. This method iterates through each `plan` in the `getPlans()` array. For each `plan`, it checks if `plan.name` (e.g., "pro") is strictly equal (`===`) to the `planName` argument (e.g., "pro").
*   If a match is found, `find()` returns the first `BillingPlan` object that satisfies the condition. If no plan matches the `planName`, `find()` returns `undefined`.

#### **5. Function `getPlanLimits(planName: string)`: Retrieving a Plan's Usage Limit**

```typescript
/**
 * Get plan limits for a given plan name
 */
export function getPlanLimits(planName: string): number {
  const plan = getPlanByName(planName)
  return plan?.limits.cost ?? getFreeTierLimit()
}
```

This function provides a safe way to get the usage limit for a given plan, with a sensible fallback.

*   **`export function getPlanLimits(planName: string): number`**: Declares a function `getPlanLimits` that takes `planName` (a string) and is guaranteed to return a `number` (the usage limit).
*   **`const plan = getPlanByName(planName)`**: It first calls `getPlanByName()` to try and find the specific plan object. The result (`plan`) could be a `BillingPlan` object or `undefined`.
*   **`return plan?.limits.cost ?? getFreeTierLimit()`**: This line is a concise way to safely access the limit and provide a default:
    *   **`plan?.limits.cost`**: This uses **Optional Chaining (`?.`)**. It safely tries to access `limits` on the `plan` object, and then `cost` within `limits`. If `plan` is `undefined` (meaning the plan wasn't found), the expression immediately stops and evaluates to `undefined` without throwing an error.
    *   **`?? getFreeTierLimit()`**: This uses the **Nullish Coalescing Operator (`??`)**. If the expression on its left side (`plan?.limits.cost`) evaluates to `null` or `undefined`, then it will use the value on its right side (`getFreeTierLimit()`). Otherwise, it uses the left-hand side value.
    *   **Simplified**: This means, "If we found the plan and it has a cost limit, return that limit. Otherwise (if the plan wasn't found or its limits were undefined), return the limit for the free tier as a default." This ensures that a numerical limit is always returned, providing a robust default even for unknown plan names.

In summary, this file centralizes billing plan configurations, making it easy to manage subscription tiers, connect them to Stripe Price IDs, define their usage limits, and retrieve this information consistently throughout the application.
