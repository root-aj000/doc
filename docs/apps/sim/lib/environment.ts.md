This TypeScript file, `env.util.ts`, is a set of **utility functions and constants designed to standardize how your application detects and reacts to different environments and feature flags.**

Instead of scattering `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'` checks throughout your codebase, this file centralizes these detections into easy-to-use variables like `isProd`, `isDev`, `isBillingEnabled`, etc. This approach makes your code cleaner, more readable, and less prone to errors when dealing with environment-specific logic.

### Core Building Blocks (Imports)

```typescript
import { env, getEnv, isTruthy } from './env'
```

This line imports three essential components from a local `./env` module. These are the foundation for how environment variables are accessed and processed in this file:

*   **`env`**: Think of `env` as a direct container (like an object) that holds all your application's environment variables. You can access them directly using dot notation, e.g., `env.NODE_ENV`. It's a convenient way to get raw environment variable values.
*   **`getEnv(key: string)`**: This is a function designed to retrieve a specific environment variable by its name (e.g., `'NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL'`). It might include additional logic like ensuring the variable exists, providing default values, or logging warnings, making it a more robust way to access variables compared to direct `env` access.
*   **`isTruthy(value: any)`**: Environment variables are often strings, even for values that represent booleans (e.g., `'true'`, `'false'`, `'1'`, `'0'`). This helper function converts these string values into actual JavaScript boolean `true` or `false`. For instance, `isTruthy('true')` would return `true`, while `isTruthy('false')` or `isTruthy('0')` would return `false`.

### Detailed Explanation of Each Exported Item

The file then exports several constants and one function, each serving a specific purpose related to environment detection or feature toggling.

#### 1. `isProd` - Production Environment Check

```typescript
export const isProd = env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
```

*   **Purpose**: To quickly determine if the application is currently running in its live, public-facing "production" environment.
*   **Explanation**: This constant checks the value of the `NODE_ENV` environment variable. If `NODE_ENV` is exactly the string `'production'`, then `isProd` will be `true`. Otherwise, it will be `false`.
*   **Why it's useful**: You might use `isProd` to enable performance optimizations, disable verbose logging, or hide developer-specific tools when the app is live.

#### 2. `isDev` - Development Environment Check

```typescript
export const isDev = env.NODE_ENV === 'development'
```

*   **Purpose**: To determine if the application is running in a "development" environment (typically on a developer's local machine).
*   **Explanation**: Similar to `isProd`, this checks if `env.NODE_ENV` is `'development'`. If it is, `isDev` is `true`.
*   **Why it's useful**: When `isDev` is `true`, you might enable features like hot-reloading, detailed error messages, or a local development server.

#### 3. `isTest` - Test Environment Check

```typescript
export const isTest = env.NODE_ENV === 'test'
```

*   **Purpose**: To determine if the application is currently running as part of an automated test suite.
*   **Explanation**: This constant checks if `env.NODE_ENV` is set to `'test'`. If so, `isTest` will be `true`.
*   **Why it's useful**: During automated testing, you often want to use mock data, prevent external API calls, adjust logging levels, or use a specific test database.

#### 4. `isHosted` - Hosted Application Check

```typescript
export const isHosted =
  getEnv('NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL') === 'https://www.sim.ai' ||
  getEnv('NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL') === 'https://www.staging.sim.ai'
```

*   **Purpose**: To identify if the application is deployed on a specific, officially hosted server instance â€“ either the main production version or a staging environment.
*   **Explanation**:
    *   `getEnv('NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL')`: This retrieves the application's full URL from an environment variable named `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`. The `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix is common in frameworks like Next.js to indicate variables exposed to the client-side.
    *   `=== 'https://www.sim.ai'`: It compares the retrieved application URL to the primary production URL.
    *   `||`: This is the logical OR operator. The entire expression will be `true` if *either* the condition before `||` *or* the condition after `||` is true.
    *   `getEnv('NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL') === 'https://www.staging.sim.ai'`: It compares the application URL to a common staging URL.
*   **Simplified Logic**: `isHosted` will be `true` if the application's URL matches *either* the main production URL (`https://www.sim.ai`) *or* the staging URL (`https://www.staging.sim.ai`). Otherwise, it's `false`.
*   **Why it's useful**: This allows you to enable or disable features that should only be active on the official, deployed versions of your application (e.g., analytics, specific third-party integrations, or user feedback widgets).

#### 5. `isBillingEnabled` - Billing Feature Flag

```typescript
export const isBillingEnabled = isTruthy(env.BILLING_ENABLED)
```

*   **Purpose**: To act as a feature flag, indicating whether the billing system within the application should be active or inactive.
*   **Explanation**:
    *   `env.BILLING_ENABLED`: This accesses the `BILLING_ENABLED` environment variable. Its value could be a string like `'true'`, `'1'`, `'false'`, or `'0'`.
    *   `isTruthy(...)`: The imported `isTruthy` function converts this string value into a proper JavaScript boolean. For example, if `env.BILLING_ENABLED` is `'true'`, `isTruthy` returns `true`, making `isBillingEnabled` `true`.
*   **Why it's useful**: This provides a simple way to turn the entire billing functionality on or off by just changing an environment variable, without needing to modify and redeploy code.

#### 6. `isEmailVerificationEnabled` - Email Verification Feature Flag

```typescript
export const isEmailVerificationEnabled = isTruthy(env.EMAIL_VERIFICATION_ENABLED)
```

*   **Purpose**: To act as a feature flag, indicating whether the email verification process for users is active.
*   **Explanation**: Very similar to `isBillingEnabled`, this constant uses the `isTruthy` helper to convert the `EMAIL_VERIFICATION_ENABLED` environment variable into a boolean. If it evaluates to `true`, then email verification steps will be enabled in your application's user flows.
*   **Why it's useful**: Like other feature flags, this allows you to easily enable or disable email verification based on your deployment strategy or rollout plans.

#### 7. `getCostMultiplier()` - Cost Adjustment Function

```typescript
export function getCostMultiplier(): number {
  return isProd ? (env.COST_MULTIPLIER ?? 1) : 1
}
```

*   **Purpose**: This function returns a numerical value that can be used to adjust costs or other numerical calculations based on the application's environment.
*   **Explanation**: This function returns a `number` and uses a conditional (ternary) operator:
    *   **`isProd ? ... : ...`**: This is a shorthand `if-else` statement.
        *   **If `isProd` is `true` (meaning the app is in production):**
            *   `(env.COST_MULTIPLIER ?? 1)`: It tries to get the value of `env.COST_MULTIPLIER`.
            *   `??`: This is the **nullish coalescing operator**. If `env.COST_MULTIPLIER` is `null` or `undefined` (meaning it's not set or has no value), it will safely fall back to `1`. Otherwise, it uses the actual value of `env.COST_MULTIPLIER`. This ensures a number is always returned.
        *   **If `isProd` is `false` (meaning the app is *not* in production, e.g., dev or test):**
            *   `: 1`: The function will simply return the number `1`.
*   **Simplified Logic**: In the production environment, the cost multiplier comes from the `COST_MULTIPLIER` environment variable (defaulting to 1 if that variable isn't set). In any other environment (development, test, staging), the cost multiplier is always `1`.
*   **Why it's useful**: This is a powerful way to prevent real costs from being incurred during development or testing, or to apply different pricing strategies based on the environment. For example, you might have a higher cost multiplier in a specific region's production environment.

In summary, `env.util.ts` provides a structured, robust, and easy-to-use way to manage environment-specific configurations and feature toggles, contributing to a more maintainable and adaptable application.
