 * tag slots throughout the application, ensuring consistency and type safety.

/**
 *  `TAG_SLOT_CONFIG`:  This is the core configuration object. It defines tag slot configurations for different field types.
 *  In this case, we only have a configuration for the `text` field type.
 *
 *  `text`: Represents the configuration for fields of type "text".
 *
 *  `slots`: An array containing the names of the available tag slots for text fields.
 *           The `as const` assertion makes this array a read-only tuple, meaning its elements cannot be modified,
 *           and the TypeScript compiler can infer the exact string literal types of its elements ('tag1', 'tag2', etc.).
 *           This is crucial for type safety and ensures that only valid tag slot names are used.
 *
 *  `maxSlots`: Specifies the maximum number of tag slots allowed for the "text" field type.  In this case, it is 7.
 *
 *  `as const`:  The outer `as const` applied to the entire `TAG_SLOT_CONFIG` object makes it a deep read-only structure.
 *  This means that all properties within the object, including nested objects and arrays, cannot be modified.
 *  This is a good practice for configuration objects as it prevents accidental mutations.

 *   In this case, it will be `['text']`.  However, the type of this expression would normally be `string[]`.
 *
 * `as Array<keyof typeof TAG_SLOT_CONFIG>`: This is a type assertion that narrows the type of the array of keys.
 *   `keyof typeof TAG_SLOT_CONFIG` evaluates to the union of the keys of `TAG_SLOT_CONFIG`, which is `'text'`.
 *   Therefore, this assertion effectively changes the type from `string[]` to `('text')[]`.  This provides stronger
 *   type checking and ensures that only valid field types are used when accessing the configuration.

export type TagSlot = (typeof TAG_SLOTS)[number]

 *   this evaluates to `readonly ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3", "tag4", "tag5", "tag6", "tag7"]`.
 *
 * `[number]`:  This is an indexed access type that retrieves the type of the elements within the `TAG_SLOTS` tuple.  In TypeScript,
 *   accessing a tuple type with `[number]` returns a union of all the element types.  Therefore, `(typeof TAG_SLOTS)[number]`
 *   evaluates to `"tag1" | "tag2" | "tag3" | "tag4" | "tag5" | "tag6" | "tag7"`.
 *
 *  The resulting `TagSlot` type represents a union of all possible tag slot names, ensuring that only valid slot names are used where this type is applied.

 *
 * `TAG_SLOT_CONFIG[fieldType as keyof typeof TAG_SLOT_CONFIG]`: This attempts to access the configuration for the given field type.
 *    - `fieldType as keyof typeof TAG_SLOT_CONFIG`: This is a type assertion.  It tells the TypeScript compiler to treat the `fieldType` string as a key of the `TAG_SLOT_CONFIG` object.  This is necessary because TypeScript needs to ensure that the `fieldType` is a valid key (e.g., 'text'). If `fieldType` is not a valid key, the expression will result in a type error.
 *    - `TAG_SLOT_CONFIG[...]`:  This accesses the `TAG_SLOT_CONFIG` object using the asserted key.  If the `fieldType` is valid (e.g., "text"), it will return the corresponding configuration object. If the `fieldType` is invalid, it will return `undefined`.
 *
 * `if (!config)`: This checks if a configuration exists for the given `fieldType`.  If `config` is `undefined` (meaning no configuration was found), the code inside the `if` block will be executed.
 *
 * `return []`: If no configuration is found, the function returns an empty array, indicating that there are no tag slots for the specified field type.
 *
 * `return config.slots`: If a configuration is found, the function returns the `slots` array from the configuration object. The return type is `readonly string[]` due to the `as const` assertion in the initial configuration.
