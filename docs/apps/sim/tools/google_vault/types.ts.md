This TypeScript file is a well-structured set of definitions designed to facilitate interaction with the Google Vault API through a custom "tool." It defines the expected input parameters and output responses for various Google Vault operations, specifically focusing on managing "Exports" and "Holds" within "Matters."

---

### Purpose of this file

The primary purpose of this file is to define **TypeScript interfaces and types** that:

1.  **Structure data:** Ensure that when a custom tool or application communicates with Google Vault for actions like creating an export, listing existing holds, or defining parameters for a legal hold, the data sent and received adheres to a predefined, consistent shape.
2.  **Enhance Developer Experience (DX):** Provide strong type-checking during development. This helps catch errors early, offers autocompletion, and makes the code more robust and easier to maintain.
3.  **Act as documentation:** The interfaces themselves serve as clear documentation for what parameters are available for each operation and what kind of data to expect in return.
4.  **Integrate with a broader tool ecosystem:** The `ToolResponse` import suggests this file is part of a larger framework where various "tools" abstract away complex API interactions, and these types specifically govern the Google Vault tool's functionality.

In essence, this file provides the **contract** for how your application will talk to the Google Vault API for specific eDiscovery and data retention tasks.

### Simplifying Complex Logic

The "complexity" in this file isn't in the TypeScript syntax itself (which is straightforward) but in the **domain concepts** it represents: Google Vault's eDiscovery features. Let's simplify these key concepts:

*   **Google Vault:** Think of it as Google's legal and compliance archive. Organizations use it to retain, hold, search, and export electronic data (emails, files, chat messages, etc.) for legal discovery or compliance purposes.
*   **Matter:** A "matter" is like a digital case file within Google Vault. It's a container for all the data, searches, exports, and legal holds related to a specific legal case, investigation, or compliance requirement.
*   **Export:** This is the process of extracting specific data from Google Vault (e.g., all emails from a certain user within a date range related to a matter) and downloading it for review.
*   **Hold (Legal Hold / Litigation Hold):** This is a critical eDiscovery function. When a legal case arises, an organization must preserve all relevant data. A "hold" in Google Vault prevents specific user data (emails, files, etc.) from being deleted or modified, even if the user tries to delete it or if standard retention policies would normally remove it. This ensures data integrity for the matter.
*   **Corpus:** Simply means "body of data" or "data source." In Google Vault, it refers to *where* the data resides (e.g., Gmail, Google Drive, Google Chat).
*   **`output: any`:** While `any` is generally discouraged in strict TypeScript, here it likely indicates that the *exact structure* of the API response for `output` can be very complex, highly variable, or might contain data structures that are not fully predictable or easily typeable without significant effort. For tool responses, sometimes `any` or `unknown` is used as a pragmatic choice when the actual content is parsed and handled downstream by the tool's specific logic.

### Explaining Each Line of Code

Let's break down the file line by line:

```typescript
import type { ToolResponse } from '@/tools/types'
```
*   `import type { ToolResponse } from '@/tools/types'`: This line imports a type definition named `ToolResponse` from a module located at `src/tools/types.ts` (indicated by the `@/` alias, common in frameworks like Next.js or Vite). The `type` keyword ensures that this import is only for type-checking purposes and does not introduce any runtime code, keeping the final JavaScript bundle smaller. `ToolResponse` is likely a base interface or type that all responses from custom tools extend, providing common properties like `success`, `message`, etc.

---

```typescript
export interface GoogleVaultCommonParams {
  accessToken: string
  matterId: string
}
```
*   `export interface GoogleVaultCommonParams {`: This declares a TypeScript interface named `GoogleVaultCommonParams`. The `export` keyword makes this interface available for use in other files. This interface serves as a base for all other Google Vault operation parameters, containing fields common to most requests.
*   `accessToken: string`: Defines a required property `accessToken` which must be a string. This is typically an OAuth 2.0 token used for authenticating with the Google Vault API.
*   `matterId: string`: Defines a required property `matterId` which must be a string. This is the unique identifier for the "matter" (legal case or investigation) within Google Vault that the operation pertains to.

---

```typescript
// Exports
export interface GoogleVaultCreateMattersExportParams extends GoogleVaultCommonParams {
  exportName: string
  corpus: GoogleVaultCorpus
  accountEmails?: string // Comma-separated list or array handled in the tool
  orgUnitId?: string
  terms?: string
  startTime?: string
  endTime?: string
  timeZone?: string
  includeSharedDrives?: boolean
}
```
*   `// Exports`: This is a comment indicating that the following interfaces and types are related to Google Vault "export" operations.
*   `export interface GoogleVaultCreateMattersExportParams extends GoogleVaultCommonParams {`: This declares an interface for parameters used when *creating a new data export* within a Google Vault matter. It `extends GoogleVaultCommonParams`, meaning it inherits `accessToken` and `matterId` from that interface and adds its own specific properties.
*   `exportName: string`: A required property for the name of the export, which must be a string.
*   `corpus: GoogleVaultCorpus`: A required property that specifies the data source (e.g., Mail, Drive) for the export. Its type `GoogleVaultCorpus` will be defined later in the file as a union of string literals.
*   `accountEmails?: string`: An optional property (`?`) for a string. It can be a comma-separated list of email addresses. The comment `// Comma-separated list or array handled in the tool` suggests that the underlying tool logic might convert this string into an array before making the actual API call, or it expects a single string of comma-separated values. This is used to narrow down the export scope to specific user accounts.
*   `orgUnitId?: string`: An optional property for an organizational unit ID (a Google Workspace concept). If provided, the export will be limited to users within that organizational unit.
*   `terms?: string`: An optional property for search terms to filter the data within the export (e.g., keywords, phrases).
*   `startTime?: string`: An optional property for the start date/time of the data to be included in the export.
*   `endTime?: string`: An optional property for the end date/time of the data to be included in the export.
*   `timeZone?: string`: An optional property to specify the time zone for `startTime` and `endTime`.
*   `includeSharedDrives?: boolean`: An optional boolean property. If `true`, the export will include data from shared drives relevant to the specified criteria.

```typescript
export interface GoogleVaultListMattersExportParams extends GoogleVaultCommonParams {
  pageSize?: number
  pageToken?: string
  exportId?: string // Short input to fetch a specific export
}
```
*   `export interface GoogleVaultListMattersExportParams extends GoogleVaultCommonParams {`: This declares an interface for parameters used when *listing existing data exports* for a Google Vault matter. It also extends `GoogleVaultCommonParams`.
*   `pageSize?: number`: An optional property (`?`) for a number, specifying the maximum number of exports to return in a single page of results. Used for pagination.
*   `pageToken?: string`: An optional property for a string, representing a token from a previous `list` call to retrieve the next page of results. Used for pagination.
*   `exportId?: string`: An optional property for a string. The comment `// Short input to fetch a specific export` clarifies that if this ID is provided, the API call should retrieve details for only that specific export, rather than a list.

---

```typescript
export interface GoogleVaultListMattersExportResponse extends ToolResponse {
  output: any
}
```
*   `export interface GoogleVaultListMattersExportResponse extends ToolResponse {`: This declares an interface for the expected response when *listing data exports*. It `extends ToolResponse`, meaning it inherits properties from the base tool response interface.
*   `output: any`: A required property named `output`. Its type is `any`, as explained earlier, suggesting the actual data structure returned by the Google Vault API for a list of exports is either highly dynamic, very complex, or intentionally left loosely typed for the tool to handle.

---

```typescript
// Holds
// Simplified: default to BASIC_HOLD by omission in requests
export type GoogleVaultHoldView = 'BASIC_HOLD' | 'FULL_HOLD'
```
*   `// Holds`: A comment indicating the following definitions are related to Google Vault "hold" (legal hold) operations.
*   `// Simplified: default to BASIC_HOLD by omission in requests`: This is an important internal comment. It tells developers that if they don't explicitly specify `GoogleVaultHoldView` in a request (where applicable), the system (likely the wrapping tool) will automatically assume `BASIC_HOLD`. This simplifies usage by providing a sensible default.
*   `export type GoogleVaultHoldView = 'BASIC_HOLD' | 'FULL_HOLD'`: This declares a **union type** named `GoogleVaultHoldView`. A union type restricts a variable to a specific set of string literal values. In this case, a hold can either be viewed or created as a `'BASIC_HOLD'` (which might mean less metadata or a broader scope) or a `'FULL_HOLD'` (potentially including more detailed metadata or a more granular scope).

---

```typescript
export type GoogleVaultCorpus = 'MAIL' | 'DRIVE' | 'GROUPS' | 'HANGOUTS_CHAT' | 'VOICE'
```
*   `export type GoogleVaultCorpus = 'MAIL' | 'DRIVE' | 'GROUPS' | 'HANGOUTS_CHAT' | 'VOICE'`: This declares another union type named `GoogleVaultCorpus`. This type defines the allowed data sources for holds and exports within Google Vault. It clearly specifies the Google services from which data can be targeted: Mail (Gmail), Drive (Google Drive files), Groups (Google Groups messages), Hangouts Chat (Google Chat messages), and Voice (Google Voice data).

---

```typescript
export interface GoogleVaultCreateMattersHoldsParams extends GoogleVaultCommonParams {
  holdName: string
  corpus: GoogleVaultCorpus
  accountEmails?: string // Comma-separated list or array handled in the tool
  orgUnitId?: string
}
```
*   `export interface GoogleVaultCreateMattersHoldsParams extends GoogleVaultCommonParams {`: This declares an interface for parameters used when *creating a new legal hold* within a Google Vault matter. It `extends GoogleVaultCommonParams`.
*   `holdName: string`: A required property for the name of the legal hold, which must be a string.
*   `corpus: GoogleVaultCorpus`: A required property specifying the data source(s) for the hold, using the `GoogleVaultCorpus` union type.
*   `accountEmails?: string`: An optional property for a string of comma-separated email addresses, similar to `GoogleVaultCreateMattersExportParams`. Used to define whose data is put on hold.
*   `orgUnitId?: string`: An optional property for an organizational unit ID, similar to `GoogleVaultCreateMattersExportParams`. Used to define which organizational unit's data is put on hold.

---

```typescript
export interface GoogleVaultListMattersHoldsParams extends GoogleVaultCommonParams {
  pageSize?: number
  pageToken?: string
  holdId?: string // Short input to fetch a specific hold
}
```
*   `export interface GoogleVaultListMattersHoldsParams extends GoogleVaultCommonParams {`: This declares an interface for parameters used when *listing existing legal holds* for a Google Vault matter. It also extends `GoogleVaultCommonParams`.
*   `pageSize?: number`: An optional property for pagination, specifying the maximum number of holds to return per page.
*   `pageToken?: string`: An optional property for pagination, providing a token for the next page of results.
*   `holdId?: string`: An optional property for a string. The comment `// Short input to fetch a specific hold` indicates that providing this ID will fetch details for a single specific hold rather than a list.

---

```typescript
export interface GoogleVaultListMattersHoldsResponse extends ToolResponse {
  output: any
}
```
*   `export interface GoogleVaultListMattersHoldsResponse extends ToolResponse {`: This declares an interface for the expected response when *listing legal holds*. It `extends ToolResponse`.
*   `output: any`: A required property named `output` of type `any`. Similar to the export response, this indicates that the exact structure of the data returned by the Google Vault API for a list of holds is either very complex or left loosely typed for the tool to manage.
