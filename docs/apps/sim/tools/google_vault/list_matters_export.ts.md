This TypeScript code defines a configuration object for a "tool" that interacts with the Google Vault API. This tool allows an application to either list all "exports" associated with a specific "matter" or retrieve the details of a single "export" within that matter.

It's designed to be part of a larger system where different `ToolConfig` objects define how to interact with various APIs or services in a standardized way. This approach abstracts away the complexities of API calls, authentication, parameter handling, and response processing, making it easier for higher-level application logic to use these capabilities.

### Purpose of this File

The primary purpose of this file is to define `listMattersExportTool`, a comprehensive configuration for a specific Google Vault API operation: retrieving information about "exports" for a given "matter."

Think of it as a blueprint or a recipe for making a very specific API call. This blueprint includes:
1.  **Identification**: What is this tool called, what's its purpose, and what version is it?
2.  **Authentication**: How do we securely access the Google Vault API? (Using OAuth with specific permissions).
3.  **Input Parameters**: What information does the tool need from a user or the system to make its request? (e.g., `matterId`, `exportId`, `pageSize`). It also defines how these parameters should be presented (e.g., visible to a user, or hidden and managed internally).
4.  **Request Construction**: How is the actual HTTP request built, including the URL, method (GET), and headers (for authentication)? This is dynamic, adapting to whether a single export or a list of exports is requested.
5.  **Response Handling**: How should the system process the API's response, including parsing the data and handling errors?

By consolidating all this information into a single `ToolConfig` object, the system can execute this Google Vault operation simply by referencing `listMattersExportTool`, without needing to re-implement the API interaction details every time.

### Simplified Complex Logic

The most notable pieces of logic that are simplified or handled robustly within this configuration are:

1.  **Dynamic URL Generation (Single vs. List)**
    *   **The Problem**: The Google Vault API has two slightly different URLs for fetching a *single* export (`/matters/{matterId}/exports/{exportId}`) versus listing *all* exports for a matter (`/matters/{matterId}/exports`).
    *   **The Solution**: The `url` property in the `request` section is a function that intelligently checks if an `exportId` is provided. If `exportId` is present, it constructs the URL for a single export. Otherwise, it defaults to the URL for listing exports. This clever branching allows a single tool configuration to serve two closely related API functions.

2.  **Robust Pagination Parameter Handling (`pageSize`)**
    *   **The Problem**: When listing items, APIs often use `pageSize` to control the number of results per page. This value might come from a user as a string, but the API expects a valid number.
    *   **The Solution**: The `url` function specifically handles `pageSize`. It attempts to convert the input `pageSize` to a `number` using `Number()`. It then performs a crucial validation step: `Number.isFinite(pageSize) && pageSize > 0`. This ensures that the `pageSize` is a real, non-infinite number and is positive before adding it to the URL query parameters. This prevents invalid input from causing API errors.

3.  **Clear Parameter Visibility (`visibility: 'hidden'` vs. `'user-only'`)**
    *   **The Problem**: Some parameters (like authentication tokens or pagination tokens) are internal system concerns, while others (like the matter ID or desired page size) are meant for user input. If building a UI on top of this tool, you need to know which is which.
    *   **The Solution**: Each parameter in the `params` object has a `visibility` property. `hidden` parameters (`accessToken`, `pageToken`) are not meant for direct user interaction and would typically be managed by the application itself. `user-only` parameters (`matterId`, `pageSize`, `exportId`) are designed to be presented to and filled by an end-user, making it easy for a UI layer to render the appropriate input fields.

4.  **Standardized API Response Processing with Error Handling**
    *   **The Problem**: API responses can be complex, and errors can come in various forms (HTTP error codes, or error messages within a successful HTTP response). A consistent way to handle these is needed.
    *   **The Solution**: The `transformResponse` function first attempts to parse *any* response as JSON. Then, it uses `response.ok` (a standard Fetch API property that indicates if the HTTP status code was in the 200-299 range) to determine success or failure. If `response.ok` is `false`, it throws an `Error`, intelligently trying to extract a specific error message from the API's JSON payload (`data.error?.message`) or falling back to a generic message. On success, it returns a consistent `{ success: true, output: data }` structure, making it easy for the calling code to interpret the result.

### Explain Each Line of Code

```typescript
import type { GoogleVaultListMattersExportParams } from '@/tools/google_vault/types'
import type { ToolConfig } from '@/tools/types'
```
*   These lines import TypeScript *types* from other files. `type` is used to ensure these imports are only for compile-time type checking and don't add any code to the final JavaScript output.
    *   `GoogleVaultListMattersExportParams`: This type likely defines the exact structure and types expected for the input parameters of this specific Google Vault API operation.
    *   `ToolConfig`: This is a generic type that defines the overall structure for *any* tool configuration in this system, ensuring consistency across different tools.

```typescript
// matters.exports.list
// GET https://vault.googleapis.com/v1/matters/{matterId}/exports
```
*   These are comments providing helpful context. They indicate that this tool is configured for the Google Vault API's `matters.exports.list` operation and show the base HTTP GET endpoint for it.

```typescript
export const listMattersExportTool: ToolConfig<GoogleVaultListMattersExportParams> = {
```
*   **`export const listMattersExportTool`**: This declares a constant variable named `listMattersExportTool` and makes it available to be used by other parts of the application (due to `export`).
*   **`: ToolConfig<GoogleVaultListMattersExportParams>`**: This is a TypeScript type annotation, specifying that `listMattersExportTool` must conform to the `ToolConfig` type, using `GoogleVaultListMattersExportParams` to specify the types of its input parameters.

```typescript
  id: 'list_matters_export',
  name: 'Vault List Exports (by Matter)',
  description: 'List exports for a matter',
  version: '1.0',
```
*   **`id`**: A unique, programmatic identifier for this specific tool.
*   **`name`**: A human-readable name for the tool, suitable for display in a user interface.
*   **`description`**: A short explanation of what the tool does.
*   **`version`**: The version of this tool configuration.

```typescript
  oauth: {
    required: true,
    provider: 'google-vault',
    additionalScopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/ediscovery'],
  },
```
*   **`oauth`**: This object defines the OAuth (Open Authorization) requirements for using this tool.
    *   **`required: true`**: Indicates that OAuth authentication is mandatory.
    *   **`provider: 'google-vault'`**: Specifies which pre-configured OAuth provider (e.g., a specific Google client ID/secret) to use from the system's overall setup.
    *   **`additionalScopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/ediscovery']`**: An array of additional permissions (OAuth scopes) that the user must grant for this tool to access the Google Vault eDiscovery features.

```typescript
  params: {
    accessToken: { type: 'string', required: true, visibility: 'hidden' },
    matterId: { type: 'string', required: true, visibility: 'user-only' },
    pageSize: { type: 'number', required: false, visibility: 'user-only' },
    pageToken: { type: 'string', required: false, visibility: 'hidden' },
    exportId: { type: 'string', required: false, visibility: 'user-only' },
  },
```
*   **`params`**: This object defines all the input parameters that the tool accepts, along with their metadata.
    *   Each property (e.g., `accessToken`, `matterId`) describes a single parameter:
        *   **`type`**: The expected data type (`'string'`, `'number'`).
        *   **`required`**: A boolean indicating if the parameter must be provided.
        *   **`visibility`**: How the parameter should be treated in terms of user interaction.
            *   **`'hidden'`**: The parameter is managed internally by the system (e.g., `accessToken` for authentication, `pageToken` for pagination) and should not be exposed to a user interface.
            *   **`'user-only'`**: The parameter is expected to be provided by an end-user (e.g., `matterId` to identify a specific case, `pageSize` to control result count, `exportId` to fetch a specific export).

```typescript
  request: {
    url: (params) => {
      if (params.exportId) {
        return `https://vault.googleapis.com/v1/matters/${params.matterId}/exports/${params.exportId}`
      }
      const url = new URL(`https://vault.googleapis.com/v1/matters/${params.matterId}/exports`)
      // Handle pageSize - convert to number if needed
      if (params.pageSize !== undefined && params.pageSize !== null) {
        const pageSize = Number(params.pageSize)
        if (Number.isFinite(pageSize) && pageSize > 0) {
          url.searchParams.set('pageSize', String(pageSize))
        }
      }
      if (params.pageToken) url.searchParams.set('pageToken', params.pageToken)
      return url.toString()
    },
    method: 'GET',
    headers: (params) => ({ Authorization: `Bearer ${params.accessToken}` }),
  },
```
*   **`request`**: This object defines how to construct the actual HTTP request.
    *   **`url: (params) => { ... }`**: This is a function that takes the `params` (the input parameters) and returns the full URL string for the API call.
        *   **`if (params.exportId)`**: Checks if the `exportId` parameter was provided.
        *   **`return `https://vault.googleapis.com/v1/matters/${params.matterId}/exports/${params.exportId}``**: If `exportId` is present, it constructs the URL to fetch a *specific* export, embedding `matterId` and `exportId` directly into the URL path.
        *   **`const url = new URL(...)`**: If `exportId` is *not* present, it means we want to list *all* exports. It initializes a `URL` object with the base listing endpoint for the given `matterId`. Using the `URL` object makes it easy to add query parameters.
        *   **`if (params.pageSize !== undefined && params.pageSize !== null)`**: Checks if a `pageSize` was provided.
            *   **`const pageSize = Number(params.pageSize)`**: Converts `pageSize` to a number, as it might initially be a string (e.g., from a form input).
            *   **`if (Number.isFinite(pageSize) && pageSize > 0)`**: Validates that the converted `pageSize` is a valid, positive finite number.
            *   **`url.searchParams.set('pageSize', String(pageSize))`**: If valid, it adds `pageSize` as a URL query parameter (e.g., `?pageSize=10`).
        *   **`if (params.pageToken) url.searchParams.set('pageToken', params.pageToken)`**: If `pageToken` is provided (for pagination), it adds it as a URL query parameter.
        *   **`return url.toString()`**: Returns the final, constructed URL as a string.
    *   **`method: 'GET'`**: Specifies that the HTTP `GET` method should be used for this request, which is standard for retrieving data.
    *   **`headers: (params) => ({ Authorization: `Bearer ${params.accessToken}` })`**: This is a function that takes the `params` and returns an object of HTTP headers.
        *   **`Authorization: `Bearer ${params.accessToken}``**: Sets the `Authorization` header, including the `accessToken` obtained via OAuth. This is crucial for authenticating the request with Google Vault.

```typescript
  transformResponse: async (response: Response) => {
    const data = await response.json()
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(data.error?.message || 'Failed to list exports')
    }

    // Return the raw API response without modifications
    return { success: true, output: data }
  },
}
```
*   **`transformResponse: async (response: Response) => { ... }`**: This asynchronous function is responsible for processing the raw `Response` object received from the API call.
    *   **`const data = await response.json()`**: Asynchronously reads the response body and parses it as JSON into a JavaScript object.
    *   **`if (!response.ok)`**: Checks if the HTTP response status code indicates an error (e.g., 400, 500 series). `response.ok` is `true` for 2xx status codes.
        *   **`throw new Error(data.error?.message || 'Failed to list exports')`**: If there was an HTTP error, it throws a JavaScript `Error`. It attempts to extract a specific error message from the parsed JSON data (often found in `data.error.message` for Google APIs). If no specific message is found, it uses a generic "Failed to list exports" message.
    *   **`return { success: true, output: data }`**: If the HTTP response was successful, it returns a standardized object indicating `success: true` and includes the parsed JSON `data` in the `output` property. This consistent return format makes it easy for the calling code to handle both successful and failed API operations.
*   **`}`**: This closes the definition of the `listMattersExportTool` constant.
