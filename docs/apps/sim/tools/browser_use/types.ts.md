This file defines a set of TypeScript interfaces. In TypeScript, an `interface` is like a blueprint that describes the *shape* an object should have. It specifies what properties an object must or might have, and what their data types are. These interfaces are crucial for ensuring that different parts of an application (like a frontend UI and a backend API) agree on the structure of the data they exchange, making the code more robust and easier to maintain.

### Purpose of this File

The primary purpose of this file is to define the data structures (inputs and outputs) for interacting with a "Browser Use" or "Automated Browser Task" feature. Imagine a system where you can programmatically instruct a browser to perform a series of actions (like filling out forms, navigating pages, or extracting data). This file provides the TypeScript types for:

1.  **Requesting a task**: What information do you need to send to start a browser automation task?
2.  **Tracking task progress**: How are individual steps within a task described?
3.  **Receiving task results**: What does the final output of a browser automation task look like?
4.  **Standardizing API responses**: How are these task results wrapped within a general API response structure?

In essence, it creates a clear contract for how to communicate with a browser automation "tool" within a larger application ecosystem.

### Simplifying Complex Logic

This file primarily consists of interface definitions, which inherently define structure rather than complex executable logic. The "complexity" here might arise from understanding how these interfaces relate and build upon each other.

The core idea is a hierarchical structure:

*   You send `BrowserUseRunTaskParams` to *start* a task.
*   The task's overall *output* (defined by `BrowserUseTaskOutput`) includes a collection of `BrowserUseTaskStep`s, which describe the journey the browser took.
*   Finally, the complete API responses (`BrowserUseRunTaskResponse` and `BrowserUseResponse`) wrap this task output along with any standard API response information.

Think of it like ordering a custom product online:
1.  **`BrowserUseRunTaskParams`**: This is your order form, specifying what you want (`task`), your payment info (`apiKey`), and any special instructions (`variables`, `model`, `save_browser_data`).
2.  **`BrowserUseTaskStep`**: As your product is built, each stage of production (e.g., "cutting fabric," "stitching seams," "packaging") is a step, with its own ID, goal, and perhaps what happened (`url`, `extracted_data`).
3.  **`BrowserUseTaskOutput`**: This is the finished product itself, including its unique ID, whether it was successfully made, the final result (`output`), and a detailed list of all the production steps.
4.  **`BrowserUseRunTaskResponse` / `BrowserUseResponse`**: This is the shipping box containing your finished product (`output`), along with a shipping label (`ToolResponse`'s properties like status or a general ID).

By breaking down the data into these specific interfaces, the system gains clarity, type safety, and reusability.

### Explaining Each Line of Code

Let's go through each part of the code:

#### 1. Import Statement

```typescript
import type { ToolResponse } from '@/tools/types'
```

*   `import type { ToolResponse } from '@/tools/types'`: This line imports a type definition called `ToolResponse` from another file located at `@/tools/types`.
    *   `import type`: This is a special TypeScript syntax that tells the compiler to only import the `ToolResponse` for type-checking purposes, and not to generate any JavaScript code for the import at runtime. This can help reduce bundle size in some scenarios.
    *   `ToolResponse`: This likely represents a common, base interface for *any* tool's response in the system. It would typically include properties common to all tool interactions, such as an overall `id`, `status`, or potential `error` information.
    *   `'@/tools/types'`: This is a module path, where `@/` typically indicates an alias configured in `tsconfig.json` or a build tool (like Webpack or Vite) that maps to a specific directory (e.g., `src/`). It helps keep import paths clean and manageable.

#### 2. BrowserUseRunTaskParams Interface

```typescript
export interface BrowserUseRunTaskParams {
  task: string
  apiKey: string
  variables?: Record<string, string>
  model?: string
  save_browser_data?: boolean
}
```

*   `export interface BrowserUseRunTaskParams`:
    *   `export`: This keyword makes the `BrowserUseRunTaskParams` interface available for use in other files that import it.
    *   `interface`: Declares a new interface named `BrowserUseRunTaskParams`. This interface defines the expected structure of an object used to *initiate* a browser automation task.
*   `task: string`:
    *   `task`: This property is a `string` and is **required**. It represents the main description or instruction for the browser automation task to perform (e.g., "Find all product prices on example.com").
*   `apiKey: string`:
    *   `apiKey`: This property is also a `string` and is **required**. It likely serves as an authentication key or identifier for the user or system initiating the task.
*   `variables?: Record<string, string>`:
    *   `variables`: This property is **optional** (indicated by `?`). If provided, its value must conform to `Record<string, string>`.
    *   `Record<string, string>`: This is a TypeScript utility type that defines an object where:
        *   All keys are `string`s.
        *   All values associated with those keys are also `string`s.
    *   This allows for passing dynamic, key-value pair parameters to the task, like `{"searchQuery": "TypeScript tutorials"}`.
*   `model?: string`:
    *   `model`: This is an **optional** `string` property. It might be used to specify a particular AI model or engine that should be used to interpret or execute the task, if the system supports multiple models.
*   `save_browser_data?: boolean`:
    *   `save_browser_data`: This is an **optional** `boolean` property. If set to `true`, it might instruct the system to persist browser session data (like cookies, local storage, or user profiles) after the task completes, potentially for use in subsequent tasks.

#### 3. BrowserUseTaskStep Interface

```typescript
export interface BrowserUseTaskStep {
  id: string
  step: number
  evaluation_previous_goal: string
  next_goal: string
  url?: string
  extracted_data?: Record<string, any>
}
```

*   `export interface BrowserUseTaskStep`: Defines the structure for a single, individual step within a larger browser automation task.
*   `id: string`:
    *   `id`: A **required** `string` that uniquely identifies this particular step.
*   `step: number`:
    *   `step`: A **required** `number` indicating the sequential order of this step within the overall task (e.g., 1, 2, 3...).
*   `evaluation_previous_goal: string`:
    *   `evaluation_previous_goal`: A **required** `string` that describes the goal that the system was trying to achieve *before* this current step. This is useful for auditing and evaluating the task's progress and decisions.
*   `next_goal: string`:
    *   `next_goal`: A **required** `string` that describes the specific objective or goal that this current step is trying to achieve.
*   `url?: string`:
    *   `url`: An **optional** `string`. If present, it would indicate the URL of the page the browser was on or navigated to during this step.
*   `extracted_data?: Record<string, any>`:
    *   `extracted_data`: An **optional** property that can hold data extracted or scraped during this step.
    *   `Record<string, any>`: This type specifies an object where:
        *   All keys are `string`s.
        *   Values can be of `any` type (meaning they can be strings, numbers, objects, arrays, etc.). This flexibility is often used when the structure of the extracted data isn't known beforehand.

#### 4. BrowserUseTaskOutput Interface

```typescript
export interface BrowserUseTaskOutput {
  id: string
  success: boolean
  output: any
  steps: BrowserUseTaskStep[]
}
```

*   `export interface BrowserUseTaskOutput`: Defines the core output or result specific to a completed browser automation task. This is the "payload" of the task's outcome.
*   `id: string`:
    *   `id`: A **required** `string` that uniquely identifies the *run* of this specific task.
*   `success: boolean`:
    *   `success`: A **required** `boolean` indicating whether the entire browser automation task completed successfully (`true`) or failed (`false`).
*   `output: any`:
    *   `output`: A **required** property that holds the final result or relevant data produced by the task. Its type is `any`, meaning it can be of any JavaScript type (string, number, object, array, etc.). This allows for highly flexible task outputs.
*   `steps: BrowserUseTaskStep[]`:
    *   `steps`: A **required** property that is an array (`[]`) of `BrowserUseTaskStep` objects. This provides a detailed, ordered log of every action or stage the browser went through to complete the task.

#### 5. BrowserUseRunTaskResponse Interface

```typescript
export interface BrowserUseRunTaskResponse extends ToolResponse {
  output: BrowserUseTaskOutput
}
```

*   `export interface BrowserUseRunTaskResponse`: Defines the complete API response structure specifically when a browser automation task is *run*.
*   `extends ToolResponse`:
    *   `extends`: This keyword indicates that `BrowserUseRunTaskResponse` *inherits* all the properties from the `ToolResponse` interface (which we imported earlier). This means a `BrowserUseRunTaskResponse` object will have all the properties defined in `ToolResponse` (e.g., `id`, `status`, `error`) in addition to its own. This promotes consistency across different tool responses.
*   `output: BrowserUseTaskOutput`:
    *   `output`: This property is **required** and its type is `BrowserUseTaskOutput`. It represents the specific, detailed result of the browser automation task, as defined by the `BrowserUseTaskOutput` interface. This property likely overrides or adds to any `output` property that might exist in the base `ToolResponse` if `ToolResponse` had a generic `output` property.

#### 6. BrowserUseResponse Interface

```typescript
export interface BrowserUseResponse extends ToolResponse {
  output: {
    id: string
    success: boolean
    output: any
    steps: BrowserUseTaskStep[]
  }
}
```

*   `export interface BrowserUseResponse`: Defines another complete API response structure, potentially for more general "Browser Use" operations beyond just running a task (though its `output` structure is identical to `BrowserUseTaskOutput`).
*   `extends ToolResponse`: Similar to `BrowserUseRunTaskResponse`, this interface also inherits all properties from the `ToolResponse` interface.
*   `output: { ... }`:
    *   `output`: This property is **required** and is defined using an *inline anonymous interface*. This means instead of referencing a named interface like `BrowserUseTaskOutput`, the structure is defined directly within this interface.
    *   `id: string`, `success: boolean`, `output: any`, `steps: BrowserUseTaskStep[]`: These properties within the inline `output` definition are **identical** to those in the `BrowserUseTaskOutput` interface.

**Note on `BrowserUseRunTaskResponse` vs. `BrowserUseResponse`:**
It's worth noting that the `output` property of `BrowserUseResponse` has the exact same structure as `BrowserUseTaskOutput`. Typically, for reusability and clarity, `BrowserUseResponse` would also be defined as `output: BrowserUseTaskOutput` instead of using an inline anonymous interface. The current definition works, but `output: BrowserUseTaskOutput` would be more DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and easier to maintain if `BrowserUseTaskOutput` were ever updated. It suggests either `BrowserUseResponse` is intended for a slightly different, though currently identical, output, or it's a slightly less optimized definition.

In summary, these interfaces provide a robust and type-safe way to define the inputs and outputs for an automated browser interaction system, ensuring clarity and consistency across the application.
