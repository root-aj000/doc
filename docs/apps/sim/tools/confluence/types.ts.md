This TypeScript file acts as a central definition hub for interacting with Confluence, specifically for "retrieve" (read) and "update" (write) operations on its pages. It's essentially a contract that specifies what data you need to provide to perform an action (parameters) and what data you can expect back as a result (responses).

Let's break it down.

## Purpose of This File

The primary purpose of this file is to define **data structures (interfaces and types)** that standardize interactions with a Confluence API. Think of it as providing blueprints for:

1.  **Input Parameters**: What information you must supply to request an action (like fetching or updating a Confluence page).
2.  **Output Responses**: What data you'll receive back after an action is completed, including the structure of successful data and common elements for all tool responses.
3.  **Core Data Models**: A basic representation of a Confluence page's key attributes.

By defining these types, this file helps ensure consistency, type-safety, and clarity across the application when communicating with Confluence, especially within a system that uses "tools" (likely referring to API integrations or specific functions that perform external actions).

## Simplifying Complex Logic

The "logic" here isn't about algorithms, but rather about **structuring data and relationships** between different data shapes. The key concepts to simplify are:

*   **Input vs. Output**: We have distinct interfaces for `Params` (what you send *in*) and `Response` (what you get *out*). This is a common and crucial pattern for API interactions.
*   **Base `ToolResponse`**: Notice how `ConfluenceRetrieveResponse` and `ConfluenceUpdateResponse` `extends ToolResponse`. This is a powerful TypeScript feature. It means they *inherit* all properties from `ToolResponse` (which is defined elsewhere, likely providing common fields like a `status` or `error` message) and then add Confluence-specific details. This ensures all "tool" responses share a consistent foundation.
*   **Optional Properties (`?`)**: Many properties have a `?` after their name (e.g., `cloudId?: string`). This simply means the property is **optional**. You don't *have* to provide it, and it might not always be present in the returned data.
*   **Union Types (`|`)**: The `ConfluenceResponse` type uses the `|` symbol. This creates a **union type**, meaning a variable of type `ConfluenceResponse` can be *either* a `ConfluenceRetrieveResponse` *or* a `ConfluenceUpdateResponse`. This is useful when a function might return one of several related response types.

## Line-by-Line Explanation

Let's go through each part of the code:

### 1. `import type { ToolResponse } from '@/tools/types'`

*   **`import type { ToolResponse } ...`**: This line imports a type named `ToolResponse` from another file.
    *   **`import type`**: This specific syntax tells TypeScript that we are only importing a `type` (not a value or a function). This is an optimization that helps ensure the imported type doesn't get compiled into the JavaScript bundle if it's only used for type checking and not for runtime operations.
    *   **`ToolResponse`**: This is an interface (or type alias) defined elsewhere. It likely provides a common structure for all responses from "tools" within the application, such as containing properties like `status`, `message`, or `errorCode`.
*   **`from '@/tools/types'`**: This specifies the path to the file where `ToolResponse` is defined. The `@/` is a common alias (often configured in `tsconfig.json` or build tools) that points to a specific directory in the project, like the root source folder.

### 2. `export interface ConfluenceRetrieveParams { ... }`

*   **`export interface ConfluenceRetrieveParams`**: This declares an interface named `ConfluenceRetrieveParams` and makes it available (`export`) for use in other files. An interface defines the structure (the "shape") that an object must have. This particular interface specifies the parameters required to **retrieve (read)** a page from Confluence.
    *   **`accessToken: string`**: A string representing the authentication token needed to access the Confluence API. This is crucial for security.
    *   **`pageId: string`**: The unique identifier for the specific Confluence page you want to retrieve.
    *   **`domain: string`**: The base URL or domain of the Confluence instance (e.g., `yourcompany.atlassian.net`).
    *   **`cloudId?: string`**: An **optional** string. This might be a specific identifier for Atlassian Cloud instances, often required for certain API calls. The `?` signifies that this property doesn't *have* to be provided.

### 3. `export interface ConfluenceRetrieveResponse extends ToolResponse { ... }`

*   **`export interface ConfluenceRetrieveResponse`**: This declares an interface for the expected response when successfully **retrieving** a Confluence page.
    *   **`extends ToolResponse`**: This is a key part. It means `ConfluenceRetrieveResponse` inherits all the properties defined in the `ToolResponse` interface (which, as discussed, likely includes common response fields like `status` or `success`).
    *   **`output: { ... }`**: This property holds the actual data returned from the Confluence page retrieval. It's an object with the following properties:
        *   **`ts: string`**: A timestamp (as a string) indicating when the data was retrieved or when the response was generated.
        *   **`pageId: string`**: The ID of the retrieved page, confirming which page's data is being returned.
        *   **`content: string`**: The full content of the Confluence page, typically in HTML or a Confluence-specific format.
        *   **`title: string`**: The title of the retrieved Confluence page.

### 4. `export interface ConfluencePage { ... }`

*   **`export interface ConfluencePage`**: This interface defines a general structure for representing key attributes of a Confluence page. This might be used for listing pages, displaying page metadata, or as an intermediate data model.
    *   **`id: string`**: The unique identifier of the Confluence page.
    *   **`title: string`**: The title of the Confluence page.
    *   **`spaceKey?: string`**: An **optional** string representing the key of the Confluence space (a collection of related pages) the page belongs to.
    *   **`url?: string`**: An **optional** string providing a direct link to the Confluence page.
    *   **`lastModified?: string`**: An **optional** string representing a timestamp of when the page was last modified.

### 5. `export interface ConfluenceUpdateParams { ... }`

*   **`export interface ConfluenceUpdateParams`**: This interface defines the parameters required to **update** an existing page in Confluence.
    *   **`accessToken: string`**: The authentication token, similar to the retrieve parameters.
    *   **`domain: string`**: The Confluence instance domain.
    *   **`pageId: string`**: The unique identifier of the Confluence page you want to update.
    *   **`title?: string`**: An **optional** new title for the page. If provided, the page's title will be updated.
    *   **`content?: string`**: An **optional** new content for the page. If provided, the page's content will be updated.
    *   **`version?: number`**: An **optional** number representing the current version of the page. This is crucial for Confluence (and many other APIs) to implement **optimistic locking**. By providing the current version, the API can detect if someone else modified the page since you last retrieved it. If the versions don't match, the update will typically fail, preventing accidental overwrites.
    *   **`cloudId?: string`**: An **optional** Confluence Cloud identifier, similar to the retrieve parameters.

### 6. `export interface ConfluenceUpdateResponse extends ToolResponse { ... }`

*   **`export interface ConfluenceUpdateResponse`**: This interface defines the expected response when successfully **updating** a Confluence page.
    *   **`extends ToolResponse`**: Like the `RetrieveResponse`, it inherits common properties from the `ToolResponse` interface.
    *   **`output: { ... }`**: This property contains data specific to the update operation's outcome.
        *   **`ts: string`**: A timestamp (as a string) indicating when the update occurred or the response was generated.
        *   **`pageId: string`**: The ID of the page that was updated, confirming the target.
        *   **`title: string`**: The current title of the page after the update (could be the new title if it was updated, or the old one if not).
        *   **`success: boolean`**: A boolean value indicating whether the update operation was successful (`true`) or failed (`false`).

### 7. `export type ConfluenceResponse = ConfluenceRetrieveResponse | ConfluenceUpdateResponse`

*   **`export type ConfluenceResponse`**: This declares a **type alias** named `ConfluenceResponse`. Type aliases allow you to give a new name to an existing type or combination of types.
*   **`= ConfluenceRetrieveResponse | ConfluenceUpdateResponse`**: This uses a **union type**. It means that any variable or parameter declared as `ConfluenceResponse` can hold a value that conforms *either* to the `ConfluenceRetrieveResponse` interface *or* to the `ConfluenceUpdateResponse` interface. This is very useful when a function or API endpoint can return different but related types of responses depending on the specific operation performed.
