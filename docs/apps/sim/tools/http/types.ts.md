This file is a fantastic example of using TypeScript to create clear, self-documenting contracts for how data should be structured in an application. Let's break it down.

---

### Purpose of This File

At its core, this file defines the **blueprints** (or **interfaces**) for two crucial concepts related to making and receiving HTTP requests within a larger system:

1.  **`RequestParams`**: Describes *everything* you might need to specify when you want to send an HTTP request (like the URL, method, headers, body, etc.).
2.  **`RequestResponse`**: Describes *everything* you can expect back when an HTTP request successfully completes (like the data, status code, and headers).

Think of it as setting up a standard "order form" for requests and a "delivery receipt" for responses. By defining these interfaces, the system ensures consistency, helps developers understand what's expected, and provides excellent type-checking benefits during development. This file likely serves as a foundational component for an HTTP client or an "integration tool" that interacts with external APIs.

### Simplified Logic Explanation

The core idea here isn't complex "logic" in the sense of algorithms, but rather defining clear **data structures**. The "complexity" arises from ensuring these structures are flexible enough to handle various HTTP request scenarios while remaining precise with TypeScript types.

*   **`TableRow[]`**: This is a common pattern for representing lists of key-value pairs, often used for things like HTTP headers or URL query parameters. Instead of just `string[]` (which could be anything), `TableRow[]` implies each item has a `name` and `value` property, making it more structured.
*   **`Record<string, string>` / `Record<string, string | Blob>`**: This is TypeScript's way of saying "an object where all keys are strings, and all values are also strings (or `Blob` in the `formData` case)." It's a versatile type for dictionaries or hash maps.
*   **`validateStatus?: (status: number) => boolean`**: This is an optional function. It's a powerful way to allow consumers of this API to define *custom rules* for what constitutes a "successful" HTTP status. For example, by default, 2xx statuses are successful, but you might want to treat a 304 (Not Modified) as a success in a specific scenario. This function allows that flexibility.
*   **`extends ToolResponse`**: This indicates that `RequestResponse` isn't just a standalone type, but it *builds upon* a more general `ToolResponse` type. This suggests a broader architecture where various "tools" in the system produce a common base response structure, and HTTP requests are just one type of "tool."

### Line-by-Line Explanation

Let's walk through each part of the code.

```typescript
import type { HttpMethod, TableRow, ToolResponse } from '@/tools/types'
```

*   **`import type`**: This is a TypeScript-specific import syntax. It means we are *only* importing type definitions (like interfaces or type aliases) from another file. This is an optimization that ensures these imports are completely removed during compilation to JavaScript, resulting in no runtime overhead.
*   **`{ HttpMethod, TableRow, ToolResponse }`**: These are the specific type definitions we're bringing into this file.
    *   **`HttpMethod`**: Likely a string literal type (e.g., `'GET' | 'POST' | 'PUT' | 'DELETE' | 'PATCH' | 'HEAD' | 'OPTIONS'`) that restricts the possible values for an HTTP method.
    *   **`TableRow`**: As discussed, this is almost certainly an interface like `{ name: string; value: string; }` used for key-value pairs.
    *   **`ToolResponse`**: This is an interface that `RequestResponse` will extend, providing a common base structure for responses from different "tools" within the application.
*   **`from '@/tools/types'`**: This specifies the module path from which to import these types. The `@/` prefix suggests an absolute path alias configured in the project's `tsconfig.json` (e.g., mapping `@` to the `src` directory), making imports cleaner and less prone to relative path issues.

```typescript
export interface RequestParams {
  url: string
  method?: HttpMethod
  headers?: TableRow[]
  body?: any
  params?: TableRow[]
  pathParams?: Record<string, string>
  formData?: Record<string, string | Blob>
  timeout?: number
  validateStatus?: (status: number) => boolean
}
```

*   **`export interface RequestParams { ... }`**:
    *   **`export`**: This keyword makes the `RequestParams` interface available for other files in the project to import and use.
    *   **`interface`**: This declares a TypeScript interface, which defines the "shape" that an object must have. It's a contract for how data should be structured.
    *   **`RequestParams`**: This is the name of the interface, clearly indicating its purpose: defining the parameters for an HTTP request.

*   **`url: string`**:
    *   **`url`**: This is a property named `url`.
    *   **`: string`**: It must be a `string` type. This property is **required** and specifies the target URL for the HTTP request.

*   **`method?: HttpMethod`**:
    *   **`method?`**: This property is optional (indicated by the `?`). If provided, it specifies the HTTP method to use.
    *   **`: HttpMethod`**: Its type is `HttpMethod` (e.g., 'GET', 'POST'), ensuring only valid HTTP verbs are used. If omitted, a default (often 'GET') would likely be applied by the underlying HTTP client.

*   **`headers?: TableRow[]`**:
    *   **`headers?`**: An optional property for custom HTTP headers.
    *   **`: TableRow[]`**: It's an array of `TableRow` objects, meaning each item in the array would likely have a `name` and `value` property (e.g., `[{ name: 'Content-Type', value: 'application/json' }]`).

*   **`body?: any`**:
    *   **`body?`**: An optional property for the request's payload.
    *   **`: any`**: Its type is `any`, which means it can be anything (e.g., a JSON object, a string, a `FormData` object). While `any` can be a powerful escape hatch, in production code, it's often better to use more specific types if possible (e.g., `object | string | FormData`) to gain more type safety. However, for a generic request body, `any` is a practical choice.

*   **`params?: TableRow[]`**:
    *   **`params?`**: An optional property for URL query parameters (the part after `?` in a URL, like `?query=search&page=1`).
    *   **`: TableRow[]`**: Like headers, it's an array of `TableRow` objects (e.g., `[{ name: 'query', value: 'typescript' }]`).

*   **`pathParams?: Record<string, string>`**:
    *   **`pathParams?`**: An optional property to handle dynamic parts of a URL path (e.g., `/users/{userId}`).
    *   **`: Record<string, string>`**: It's an object where both keys and values are strings. This allows you to define replacements, for example, `{ userId: '123' }` could be used to transform `/users/{userId}` into `/users/123`.

*   **`formData?: Record<string, string | Blob>`**:
    *   **`formData?`**: An optional property specifically for `multipart/form-data` requests, often used for file uploads or complex form submissions.
    *   **`: Record<string, string | Blob>`**: It's an object where keys are strings, and values can be either `string` (for text fields) or `Blob` (for file data).

*   **`timeout?: number`**:
    *   **`timeout?`**: An optional property to specify the maximum time (in milliseconds) to wait for a response.
    *   **`: number`**: Its type is `number`.

*   **`validateStatus?: (status: number) => boolean`**:
    *   **`validateStatus?`**: An optional property that, if provided, should be a function.
    *   **`: (status: number) => boolean`**: This describes the function's signature: it takes one argument `status` (which is a `number`, the HTTP status code) and must return a `boolean` (true if the status is considered successful, false otherwise).

---

```typescript
export interface RequestResponse extends ToolResponse {
  output: {
    data: any
    status: number
    headers: Record<string, string>
  }
}
```

*   **`export interface RequestResponse`**:
    *   **`export`**: Makes this interface available for other files.
    *   **`interface RequestResponse`**: Defines the shape for an object representing the outcome of an HTTP request.

*   **`extends ToolResponse`**:
    *   This keyword indicates that `RequestResponse` inherits all properties from the `ToolResponse` interface. This is a powerful feature of interfaces for code reuse and maintaining a consistent base structure across related types. It implies `ToolResponse` might define common properties like `success: boolean` or `error: string | null` that all tool outputs share.

*   **`output: { ... }`**:
    *   **`output`**: This is a required property within `RequestResponse`. It's an object that encapsulates the actual details of the HTTP response. Using a nested `output` object often helps categorize and organize response data, especially when `RequestResponse` extends another base interface which might have its own top-level properties.

*   **`data: any`**:
    *   **`data`**: The core content returned by the server.
    *   **`: any`**: Like `body` in `RequestParams`, it's typed as `any` to accommodate various response formats (e.g., JSON, XML, plain text, binary data).

*   **`status: number`**:
    *   **`status`**: The HTTP status code of the response (e.g., 200 for OK, 404 for Not Found, 500 for Internal Server Error).
    *   **`: number`**: It's a `number` type.

*   **`headers: Record<string, string>`**:
    *   **`headers`**: An object containing all the HTTP response headers.
    *   **`: Record<string, string>`**: It's a dictionary-like object where keys are header names (strings) and values are header values (strings).
