This TypeScript file is a crucial part of an application that integrates with Google Drive. It defines the "language" or data structures (types and interfaces) for how your application communicates with and understands responses from Google Drive-related operations.

Think of it as setting up clear blueprints for all the data involved when you're asking Google Drive to do something (like list files, upload a file, or get file content) or when Google Drive sends back information.

### Purpose of This File

The primary purpose of this file is to establish a strong, type-safe contract for Google Drive operations within a larger TypeScript application. Specifically, it:

1.  **Defines Google Drive File Structure:** Specifies the properties and their types for a single file or folder on Google Drive (`GoogleDriveFile`).
2.  **Standardizes API Responses:** Creates distinct types for different Google Drive API responses (e.g., listing files, uploading a file, getting file content), ensuring they all share a common base (`ToolResponse`) and have predictable output formats.
3.  **Specifies Tool Parameters:** Outlines all the possible input parameters required when invoking a Google Drive tool or function within the application (`GoogleDriveToolParams`).
4.  **Creates a Union Type for Responses:** Provides a single, overarching type (`GoogleDriveResponse`) that represents *any* possible successful response from a Google Drive operation, making it easier to handle different outcomes in a type-safe manner.

In essence, this file ensures that when your code deals with Google Drive data, it knows exactly what to expect, preventing common errors that arise from mismatched data structures.

### Simplified Logic Explanation

At its core, this file breaks down Google Drive interactions into three main categories:

1.  **The Google Drive File Itself (`GoogleDriveFile`):** This is the fundamental building block. It describes what information we care about for any item (file or folder) in Google Drive, like its ID, name, and type.
2.  **Actions and Their Results (`GoogleDriveListResponse`, `GoogleDriveUploadResponse`, `GoogleDriveGetContentResponse`):** When your application asks Google Drive to *do* something, it gets a result. These interfaces define the specific shape of those results.
    *   **Listing files:** You get an array of `GoogleDriveFile` objects, and possibly a `nextPageToken` if there are more results.
    *   **Uploading a file:** You get back the details of the *single* `GoogleDriveFile` that was just uploaded.
    *   **Getting file content:** You get the actual `content` of the file (as a string) and its `metadata` (the `GoogleDriveFile` details).
    *   **Common Base:** All these responses `extend ToolResponse`, meaning they share some common properties defined elsewhere (likely status, error messages, etc., common to all "tools" in your system). They all wrap their specific data inside an `output` property.
3.  **Inputs for Actions (`GoogleDriveToolParams`):** Before you can ask Google Drive to do something, you need to tell it *what* to do and with *what* data. This interface lists all the possible pieces of information you might need to provide, such as the `accessToken` for authorization, `fileId` for a specific file, or `content` to upload.
4.  **The "Any Google Drive Response" Type (`GoogleDriveResponse`):** This is a handy type that says "this variable could be *any one* of the specific Google Drive response types." It's useful when you have a function that might perform different Google Drive operations and return different kinds of results.

### Line-by-Line Explanation

Let's go through each part of the code:

```typescript
import type { ToolResponse } from '@/tools/types'
```

*   **`import type { ToolResponse } from '@/tools/types'`**:
    *   `import type`: This is a TypeScript-specific import. It tells the compiler to only import the `ToolResponse` *type* (not actual JavaScript code). This helps keep your compiled JavaScript bundle smaller as types are removed during compilation.
    *   `ToolResponse`: This is a type/interface imported from another file. It likely defines a common structure for all responses from "tools" within your application (e.g., a `status` property, an `errorMessage` property, etc.). By `extending` this later, all Google Drive responses will inherit these common properties, ensuring consistency across your application's tool integrations.
    *   `'@/tools/types'`: This is a path alias (e.g., configured in `tsconfig.json`). It's a shorthand for a longer path, making imports cleaner and easier to manage, typically pointing to a `src/tools/types.ts` file or similar.

```typescript
export interface GoogleDriveFile {
  id: string
  name: string
  mimeType: string
  webViewLink?: string
  webContentLink?: string
  size?: string
  createdTime?: string
  modifiedTime?: string
  parents?: string[]
}
```

*   **`export interface GoogleDriveFile`**:
    *   `export`: This keyword makes the `GoogleDriveFile` interface available for use in other TypeScript files that `import` it.
    *   `interface`: This keyword defines a new type that specifies the "shape" of an object. It describes the properties an object must or might have.
    *   `GoogleDriveFile`: This is the name of our interface, representing a single file or folder object returned by the Google Drive API.
    *   **`id: string`**: The unique identifier for the file or folder within Google Drive. This property is mandatory (`:` indicates it must be present).
    *   **`name: string`**: The name of the file or folder. Mandatory.
    *   **`mimeType: string`**: The MIME type of the file (e.g., `image/jpeg`, `application/pdf`, `application/vnd.google-apps.folder` for a folder). Mandatory.
    *   **`webViewLink?: string`**: An optional (`?`) property. If present, it's a URL that allows users to view the file in a web browser (e.g., Google Docs viewer).
    *   **`webContentLink?: string`**: An optional property. If present, it's a URL that allows users to directly download the file content.
    *   **`size?: string`**: An optional property. The size of the file in bytes, typically represented as a string.
    *   **`createdTime?: string`**: An optional property. The timestamp when the file was created, typically in ISO 8601 format.
    *   **`modifiedTime?: string`**: An optional property. The timestamp when the file was last modified, typically in ISO 8601 format.
    *   **`parents?: string[]`**: An optional property. An array of strings, where each string is the `id` of a parent folder for this file. A file can have multiple parents in Google Drive (shared files).

---

```typescript
export interface GoogleDriveListResponse extends ToolResponse {
  output: {
    files: GoogleDriveFile[]
    nextPageToken?: string
  }
}
```

*   **`export interface GoogleDriveListResponse extends ToolResponse`**:
    *   `GoogleDriveListResponse`: This interface defines the expected structure of a response when you ask Google Drive to list files.
    *   `extends ToolResponse`: This means `GoogleDriveListResponse` inherits all the properties defined in the `ToolResponse` interface. It adds its own specific properties on top of those.
    *   **`output: { ... }`**: This is a mandatory property, an object that encapsulates the actual data payload of the response. This pattern (wrapping specific data in an `output` object) is common in API designs.
        *   **`files: GoogleDriveFile[]`**: Inside the `output` object, this mandatory property is an array (`[]`) of `GoogleDriveFile` objects. This is the list of files and/or folders found by the operation.
        *   **`nextPageToken?: string`**: An optional property. If the list of files is too large to return all at once, Google Drive provides a `nextPageToken`. You can use this token in a subsequent request to get the next "page" of results, enabling pagination.

```typescript
export interface GoogleDriveUploadResponse extends ToolResponse {
  output: {
    file: GoogleDriveFile
  }
}
```

*   **`export interface GoogleDriveUploadResponse extends ToolResponse`**:
    *   `GoogleDriveUploadResponse`: This interface defines the expected structure of a response after successfully uploading a file to Google Drive.
    *   `extends ToolResponse`: Inherits properties from `ToolResponse`.
    *   **`output: { ... }`**: The data payload object.
        *   **`file: GoogleDriveFile`**: Inside the `output` object, this mandatory property represents the single `GoogleDriveFile` object that was just uploaded, including its newly assigned ID and other details.

---

```typescript
export interface GoogleDriveGetContentResponse extends ToolResponse {
  output: {
    content: string
    metadata: GoogleDriveFile
  }
}
```

*   **`export interface GoogleDriveGetContentResponse extends ToolResponse`**:
    *   `GoogleDriveGetContentResponse`: This interface defines the expected structure of a response when you retrieve the actual content of a specific Google Drive file.
    *   `extends ToolResponse`: Inherits properties from `ToolResponse`.
    *   **`output: { ... }`**: The data payload object.
        *   **`content: string`**: Inside the `output` object, this mandatory property holds the actual content of the file as a string (e.g., the text of a document, or a base64 encoded string for binary files depending on implementation).
        *   **`metadata: GoogleDriveFile`**: This mandatory property provides the `GoogleDriveFile` details (metadata) of the file whose content was retrieved.

```typescript
export interface GoogleDriveToolParams {
  accessToken: string
  folderId?: string
  folderSelector?: string
  fileId?: string
  fileName?: string
  content?: string
  mimeType?: string
  query?: string
  pageSize?: number
  pageToken?: string
  exportMimeType?: string
}
```

*   **`export interface GoogleDriveToolParams`**:
    *   `GoogleDriveToolParams`: This interface defines all the possible parameters that can be passed to a function or "tool" that performs an operation on Google Drive.
    *   **`accessToken: string`**: Mandatory. This is the authorization token (e.g., OAuth 2.0 access token) required to authenticate the request with Google Drive.
    *   **`folderId?: string`**: Optional. The ID of a specific Google Drive folder. Used when you want to target an operation to a particular folder (e.g., list files *within* this folder, upload *to* this folder).
    *   **`folderSelector?: string`**: Optional. An alternative to `folderId`. This might be a human-readable path or a name that the system then resolves to a `folderId`.
    *   **`fileId?: string`**: Optional. The ID of a specific Google Drive file. Used when you want to perform an operation on a single file (e.g., get content of *this* file, delete *this* file).
    *   **`fileName?: string`**: Optional. The name of a file. Used when creating a new file or searching by name.
    *   **`content?: string`**: Optional. The actual content of a file to be uploaded or created, usually as a string.
    *   **`mimeType?: string`**: Optional. The MIME type of the content being uploaded or created (e.g., `text/plain`, `application/pdf`).
    *   **`query?: string`**: Optional. A search query string, often in the Google Drive Query Language format, to filter files when listing them.
    *   **`pageSize?: number`**: Optional. The maximum number of results to return per page when listing files.
    *   **`pageToken?: string`**: Optional. The token received from a previous `GoogleDriveListResponse` to retrieve the next page of results.
    *   **`exportMimeType?: string`**: Optional. Specifies the desired MIME type when exporting a Google Docs/Sheets/Slides file to a different format (e.g., export a Google Doc as `application/pdf`).

```typescript
export type GoogleDriveResponse =
  | GoogleDriveUploadResponse
  | GoogleDriveGetContentResponse
  | GoogleDriveListResponse
```

*   **`export type GoogleDriveResponse`**:
    *   `export type`: This keyword defines a new type alias, which can be a combination or a shorthand for other types.
    *   `GoogleDriveResponse`: This is the name of our type alias.
    *   `=` : Assigns the definition to the type alias.
    *   `|`: This is the union operator in TypeScript. It means "this type can be one OR the other OR the other."
    *   `GoogleDriveUploadResponse | GoogleDriveGetContentResponse | GoogleDriveListResponse`: This defines `GoogleDriveResponse` as a union of the three specific response interfaces we defined earlier.
        *   This is incredibly useful because it allows a function to return *any* of these three types, and TypeScript will correctly understand that the returned value will conform to one of them. You can then use type narrowing (e.g., checking for the presence of specific properties) to determine which specific response type you're dealing with at runtime.
