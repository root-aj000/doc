This TypeScript file is a utility for working with Google Workspace document types, particularly focusing on handling and converting tabular data (like Google Sheets) into a standardized CSV format.

It defines several constants related to Google's MIME types for its applications and provides a robust function (`handleSheetsFormat`) to convert various input formats (strings, arrays of arrays, arrays of objects) into a CSV string, along with row and column counts.

---

## 1. Purpose of this File

This file serves two primary purposes:

1.  **Standardize Google Workspace MIME Types and Export Formats:** It provides a clear, centralized place to list Google Workspace application MIME types and their default export/source formats. This is crucial for applications that interact with Google Drive API or similar services, where identifying file types and specifying desired export formats is common.
2.  **Robust Tabular Data (Sheets-like) Processing:** The `handleSheetsFormat` function offers a flexible way to take various forms of data (potentially coming from APIs, user input, or other sources) that *represent* a table, and reliably convert it into a well-formatted CSV string. It also extracts basic dimensions (row and column counts), making it a valuable tool for data integration, transformation, or display.

In essence, it acts as a **configuration hub** for Google Workspace file conversions and a **data normalization utility** for tabular data.

## 2. Detailed Explanation of Code

Let's break down each part of the code.

### 2.1. Google Workspace MIME Type Constants

These `export const` declarations define static lists and mappings that are made available for other parts of your application to use.

#### `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_MIME_TYPES`

```typescript
export const GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_MIME_TYPES = [
  'application/vnd.google-apps.document', // Google Docs
  'application/vnd.google-apps.spreadsheet', // Google Sheets
  'application/vnd.google-apps.presentation', // Google Slides
  'application/vnd.google-apps.drawing', // Google Drawings
  'application/vnd.google-apps.form', // Google Forms
  'application/vnd.google-apps.script', // Google Apps Scripts
]
```

*   **`export const GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_MIME_TYPES = [`:** This line declares a constant variable named `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_MIME_TYPES`. The `export` keyword makes this variable accessible from other TypeScript files that import it. It's an array, indicated by the square brackets `[]`.
*   **`'application/vnd.google-apps.document',`**: This is a string literal representing the MIME type for Google Docs. MIME types are standard identifiers used to denote the nature and format of a document, file, or byte stream. Google uses specific `application/vnd.google-apps.*` MIME types for its native file formats.
*   **`// Google Docs`**: This is a comment, providing human-readable context for the MIME type.
*   The subsequent lines list the MIME types for other Google Workspace applications: Google Sheets, Slides, Drawings, Forms, and Apps Scripts.

**Simplified Logic:** This is simply a list of official "file type codes" that Google uses for its native documents.

#### `DEFAULT_EXPORT_FORMATS`

```typescript
export const DEFAULT_EXPORT_FORMATS: Record<string, string> = {
  'application/vnd.google-apps.document': 'text/plain',
  'application/vnd.google-apps.spreadsheet': 'text/csv',
  'application/vnd.google-apps.presentation': 'text/plain',
  'application/vnd.google-apps.drawing': 'image/png',
  'application/vnd.google-apps.form': 'application/pdf',
  'application/vnd.google-apps.script': 'application/json',
}
```

*   **`export const DEFAULT_EXPORT_FORMATS: Record<string, string> = {`**: This declares another exported constant, `DEFAULT_EXPORT_FORMATS`.
    *   **: `Record<string, string>`**: This is a TypeScript utility type. It signifies that `DEFAULT_EXPORT_FORMATS` is an object where the keys are `string`s and the values are also `string`s. In this context, the keys are Google Workspace MIME types, and the values are their suggested default export formats.
*   **`'application/vnd.google-apps.document': 'text/plain',`**: This is a key-value pair within the object. It maps the Google Docs MIME type to `text/plain`, meaning if you want to export a Google Doc, `text/plain` is a common default target format (e.g., getting its content as raw text).
*   Similarly, it defines default export mappings for other Google file types: Sheets to CSV, Slides to plain text, Drawings to PNG images, Forms to PDF, and Apps Scripts to JSON.

**Simplified Logic:** This is a dictionary that tells you, "If I have a Google Doc, I can usually export it as plain text. If it's a Google Sheet, CSV is a good default, etc." It provides common conversion targets.

#### `SOURCE_MIME_TYPES`

```typescript
export const SOURCE_MIME_TYPES: Record<string, string> = {
  'application/vnd.google-apps.document': 'text/plain',
  'application/vnd.google-apps.spreadsheet': 'text/csv',
  'application/vnd.google-apps.presentation': 'application/vnd.ms-powerpoint',
}
```

*   **`export const SOURCE_MIME_TYPES: Record<string, string> = {`**: Similar to `DEFAULT_EXPORT_FORMATS`, this declares an exported constant `SOURCE_MIME_TYPES` as an object mapping string keys to string values.
*   **`'application/vnd.google-apps.document': 'text/plain',`**: Like `DEFAULT_EXPORT_FORMATS`, a Google Doc can be sourced as plain text.
*   **`'application/vnd.google-apps.spreadsheet': 'text/csv',`**: A Google Sheet can be sourced as CSV.
*   **`'application/vnd.google-apps.presentation': 'application/vnd.ms-powerpoint',`**: This is an interesting one. Unlike `DEFAULT_EXPORT_FORMATS` which suggested `text/plain` for Slides, this suggests `application/vnd.ms-powerpoint`. This implies a specific use case, perhaps for compatibility when converting a Google Slides presentation into a Microsoft PowerPoint format, rather than just extracting its text content.

**Simplified Logic:** This is another dictionary that suggests specific "source" formats. It's similar to `DEFAULT_EXPORT_FORMATS` but might be used when an external system expects a specific non-Google format for a given Google file type (e.g., converting Google Slides *specifically* to PowerPoint for broader compatibility).

---

### 2.2. `handleSheetsFormat` Function

This function is the most complex part of the file. Its main goal is to take various types of input that represent tabular data and convert them into a standardized CSV string, while also calculating the number of rows and columns.

```typescript
export function handleSheetsFormat(input: unknown): {
  csv?: string
  rowCount: number
  columnCount: number
} {
  // ... function body ...
}
```

*   **`export function handleSheetsFormat(input: unknown): { ... }`**:
    *   **`export function handleSheetsFormat`**: Declares an exported function named `handleSheetsFormat`.
    *   **`(input: unknown)`**: It accepts a single argument named `input`, which is of type `unknown`. This means the function is designed to handle *any* possible data type for its input, requiring careful type checking inside.
    *   **`: { csv?: string; rowCount: number; columnCount: number }`**: This specifies the return type. The function will always return an object with three properties:
        *   `csv?: string`: An optional property `csv` (indicated by `?`) which, if present, will be a string. This will hold the generated CSV content.
        *   `rowCount: number`: The number of rows in the processed data.
        *   `columnCount: number`: The number of columns in the processed data.

Now, let's go line by line through the function's body:

#### **Initial Input Handling & JSON Parsing**

```typescript
  let workingValue: unknown = input

  if (typeof workingValue === 'string') {
    try {
      workingValue = JSON.parse(workingValue)
    } catch (_error) {
      const csvString = workingValue as string
      return { csv: csvString, rowCount: 0, columnCount: 0 }
    }
  }
```

1.  **`let workingValue: unknown = input`**: A new variable `workingValue` is declared and initialized with the `input`. It also has the `unknown` type, meaning TypeScript won't make assumptions about its structure until explicitly checked. This is done so that `input` remains untouched, and `workingValue` can be transformed.
2.  **`if (typeof workingValue === 'string') {`**: Checks if the `workingValue` is currently a `string`. If it is, there's a possibility it's a JSON string that needs to be parsed, or it could be a raw CSV string.
3.  **`try { workingValue = JSON.parse(workingValue) }`**: Attempts to parse `workingValue` as a JSON string.
    *   If successful, `workingValue` will be updated to the parsed JavaScript object or array. TypeScript will narrow its type based on the result of `JSON.parse`.
4.  **`catch (_error) {`**: If `JSON.parse` fails (meaning the string is not valid JSON), the code within this `catch` block is executed. The `_error` variable (prefixed with `_`) signifies that the error object itself isn't used in this specific handler.
5.  **`const csvString = workingValue as string`**: If JSON parsing fails, the assumption is that the original string *might* just be a raw CSV string itself. We cast `workingValue` back to `string` (because `workingValue` was still `unknown` within the `catch` block for the string value).
6.  **`return { csv: csvString, rowCount: 0, columnCount: 0 }`**: If the input was a string that couldn't be parsed as JSON, it's treated as a literal CSV string. The function immediately returns this string as `csv`, with `rowCount` and `columnCount` set to `0` because its internal structure isn't further analyzed in this specific path.

**Simplified Logic:** If the input is a string, try to treat it as JSON. If it *is* JSON, parse it. If it *isn't* JSON, assume it's already a plain CSV string and return it directly.

#### **Handling Non-Array Inputs**

```typescript
  if (!Array.isArray(workingValue)) {
    return { rowCount: 0, columnCount: 0 }
  }
```

1.  **`if (!Array.isArray(workingValue)) {`**: After the potential JSON parsing, this check determines if `workingValue` is *not* an array. This covers cases where:
    *   The original input was never a string (e.g., a number, a boolean, `null`, an object).
    *   The original input was a JSON string that parsed into a non-array value (e.g., `{ "key": "value" }`).
    *   The original input was simply an object.
    *   In all these cases, `workingValue` doesn't represent tabular data that can be converted to CSV in the expected format.
2.  **`return { rowCount: 0, columnCount: 0 }`**: If `workingValue` is not an array, the function returns an object indicating zero rows and zero columns, and no `csv` property, as it cannot be meaningfully converted to a standard sheet format.

**Simplified Logic:** If the input (after any JSON parsing) isn't an array, it's not "sheet-like" data, so return empty dimensions.

#### **Standardizing Array of Objects to Array of Arrays**

```typescript
  let table: unknown[] = workingValue

  if (
    table.length > 0 &&
    typeof (table as any)[0] === 'object' &&
    (table as any)[0] !== null &&
    !Array.isArray((table as any)[0])
  ) {
    const allKeys = new Set<string>()
    ;(table as any[]).forEach((obj) => {
      if (obj && typeof obj === 'object') {
        Object.keys(obj).forEach((key) => allKeys.add(key))
      }
    })
    const headers = Array.from(allKeys)
    const rows = (table as any[]).map((obj) => {
      if (!obj || typeof obj !== 'object') {
        return Array(headers.length).fill('')
      }
      return headers.map((key) => {
        const value = (obj as Record<string, unknown>)[key]
        if (value !== null && typeof value === 'object') {
          return JSON.stringify(value)
        }
        return value === undefined ? '' : (value as any)
      })
    })
    table = [headers, ...rows]
  }
```

1.  **`let table: unknown[] = workingValue`**: At this point, `workingValue` is guaranteed to be an array (`Array.isArray(workingValue)` is true). It's assigned to a new variable `table`, typed as `unknown[]` for flexibility.
2.  **`if (table.length > 0 && typeof (table as any)[0] === 'object' && (table as any)[0] !== null && !Array.isArray((table as any)[0])) {`**: This is a key conditional block. It checks if the `table` is an array of *objects* (where each object represents a row) rather than an array of arrays (where each inner array is a row).
    *   `table.length > 0`: Ensures the array is not empty.
    *   `typeof (table as any)[0] === 'object'`: Checks if the *first element* of the array is an object. `(table as any)[0]` is a type assertion to `any` to allow accessing `[0]` safely when `table` is `unknown[]`.
    *   `(table as any)[0] !== null`: Excludes `null`, as `typeof null` also returns `'object'`.
    *   `!Array.isArray((table as any)[0])`: Ensures the first element is an object, *not* another array (if it were an array, it would already be in a suitable format).
3.  **`const allKeys = new Set<string>()`**: Initializes an empty `Set`. A `Set` only stores unique values, which is perfect for collecting all possible column headers without duplicates.
4.  **`(table as any[]).forEach((obj) => { ... })`**: Iterates through each element (`obj`) in the `table` array. Since `table` is `unknown[]`, we use `(table as any[])` to allow iterating over elements as if they could be objects.
5.  **`if (obj && typeof obj === 'object') { Object.keys(obj).forEach((key) => allKeys.add(key)) }`**: If an element `obj` is a valid (non-null) object, it extracts all its property names (keys) using `Object.keys(obj)` and adds each unique key to the `allKeys` `Set`. This effectively gathers all column names from all rows.
6.  **`const headers = Array.from(allKeys)`**: Converts the `Set` of unique keys into a new array. This `headers` array will form the first row of our CSV.
7.  **`const rows = (table as any[]).map((obj) => { ... })`**: This `map` function transforms each original `obj` (row object) into an array of values, ensuring the values are in the order defined by `headers`.
8.  **`if (!obj || typeof obj !== 'object') { return Array(headers.length).fill('') }`**: If an element in the original `table` was not a valid object (after all the checks, this could happen if the array was mixed), it's converted into a row of empty strings matching the number of headers.
9.  **`return headers.map((key) => { ... })`**: For each valid object `obj`, this inner `map` iterates through the `headers` array (the column names).
10. **`const value = (obj as Record<string, unknown>)[key]`**: It retrieves the value corresponding to the current `key` (column name) from the current `obj` (row object). `(obj as Record<string, unknown>)` is a type assertion to treat `obj` as an object with string keys and `unknown` values.
11. **`if (value !== null && typeof value === 'object') { return JSON.stringify(value) }`**: If a cell's `value` is itself an object (e.g., a nested JSON object), it's converted into its JSON string representation. This prevents `[object Object]` appearing in the CSV.
12. **`return value === undefined ? '' : (value as any)`**: If the `value` is `undefined`, it's replaced with an empty string. Otherwise, the value is returned as is (casted to `any` for simplicity as `value` is still `unknown` within the `map` callback).
13. **`table = [headers, ...rows]`**: This is the crucial transformation. The `table` variable is re-assigned. It now contains a new array where the first element is the `headers` array, followed by all the `rows` (which are now arrays of values). This converts an array of objects (`[{col1: v1, col2: v2}, {col1: v3, col2: v4}]`) into a standardized array of arrays (`[[col1, col2], [v1, v2], [v3, v4]]`).

**Simplified Logic:** If the input is an array of objects (like JSON data where each object is a row), this block intelligently figures out all unique column names, creates a header row, and then converts each object into an array of values, ensuring the correct column order. This effectively transforms data from `{ name: "Alice", age: 30 }` into `["Alice", 30]`, with `["name", "age"]` as a header.

#### **CSV Cell Escaping Helper Function**

```typescript
  const escapeCell = (cell: unknown): string => {
    if (cell === null || cell === undefined) return ''
    const stringValue = String(cell)
    const mustQuote = /[",\n\r]/.test(stringValue)
    const doubledQuotes = stringValue.replace(/"/g, '""')
    return mustQuote ? `"${doubledQuotes}"` : doubledQuotes
  }
```

1.  **`const escapeCell = (cell: unknown): string => { ... }`**: Defines a local helper function `escapeCell` that takes an `unknown` value (`cell`) and returns a `string`. This function is responsible for correctly formatting a single cell's content for CSV.
2.  **`if (cell === null || cell === undefined) return ''`**: If the cell's value is `null` or `undefined`, it's treated as an empty string in the CSV.
3.  **`const stringValue = String(cell)`**: Converts the cell's value to its string representation.
4.  **`const mustQuote = /[",\n\r]/.test(stringValue)`**: This uses a regular expression to check if the `stringValue` contains any of the characters that require a CSV cell to be enclosed in double quotes: a comma (`,`), a double quote (`"`), a newline (`\n`), or a carriage return (`\r`).
5.  **`const doubledQuotes = stringValue.replace(/"/g, '""')`**: According to CSV standards, if a cell contains a double quote character, that double quote must be escaped by *doubling* it (e.g., `"hello"` becomes `""hello""`). This line performs that replacement.
6.  **`return mustQuote ? `"${doubledQuotes}"` : doubledQuotes`**: Finally, this line determines the output:
    *   If `mustQuote` is `true` (meaning the cell contained special characters), the `doubledQuotes` string is wrapped in double quotes (e.g., `some,"value"` becomes `"some,""value""`).
    *   Otherwise, the `doubledQuotes` string (which might just be the original string if no quotes were present) is returned as is.

**Simplified Logic:** This function takes any value and converts it into a safe string for CSV. It handles empty values, converts everything to a string, and correctly escapes commas, newlines, and double quotes by wrapping the whole cell in double quotes and doubling any internal double quotes.

#### **Generating CSV String**

```typescript
  const rowsAsStrings = (table as unknown[]).map((row) => {
    if (!Array.isArray(row)) {
      return escapeCell(row)
    }
    return row.map((cell) => escapeCell(cell)).join(',')
  })

  const csv = rowsAsStrings.join('\r\n')
```

1.  **`const rowsAsStrings = (table as unknown[]).map((row) => { ... })`**: This `map` function iterates through each `row` in the `table` (which is now guaranteed to be an array, and likely an array of arrays after the previous steps).
2.  **`if (!Array.isArray(row)) { return escapeCell(row) }`**: This is a fallback. If a `row` somehow isn't an array (e.g., the initial input was `[1, "text", {a:1}]` and the object transformation didn't apply), it treats that single item as a cell and escapes it.
3.  **`return row.map((cell) => escapeCell(cell)).join(',')`**: For each `row` (which is an array of cells), it maps over each `cell`, applies the `escapeCell` function to it, and then joins these escaped cell strings together with a comma (`,`) to form a complete CSV line.
4.  **`const csv = rowsAsStrings.join('\r\n')`**: All the individual CSV lines (stored in `rowsAsStrings`) are joined together using `'\r\n'` (carriage return + newline) as the line separator. This is a common and widely compatible line ending for CSV files.

**Simplified Logic:** This section takes the prepared `table` data, converts each row into a single CSV string (applying the `escapeCell` logic), and then combines all these row strings into one complete CSV document.

#### **Calculating Row and Column Counts**

```typescript
  const rowCount = Array.isArray(table) ? (table as any[]).length : 0
  const columnCount =
    Array.isArray(table) && Array.isArray((table as any[])[0]) ? (table as any[])[0].length : 0
```

1.  **`const rowCount = Array.isArray(table) ? (table as any[]).length : 0`**: Calculates the `rowCount`. If `table` is indeed an array, its length is taken as the row count. Otherwise, `0` is used. (At this point in the function, `table` *should* always be an array, but this adds robustness).
2.  **`const columnCount = Array.isArray(table) && Array.isArray((table as any[])[0]) ? (table as any[])[0].length : 0`**: Calculates the `columnCount`. It checks two conditions:
    *   `Array.isArray(table)`: Ensures `table` is an array.
    *   `Array.isArray((table as any[])[0])`: Checks if the *first row* of the `table` is also an array. If both are true, the length of this first inner array (`[0].length`) is taken as the column count. This assumes all rows have a consistent number of columns. Otherwise, `0` is used.

**Simplified Logic:** It counts the number of top-level arrays for rows and the number of elements in the first inner array for columns.

#### **Return Value**

```typescript
  return { csv, rowCount, columnCount }
```

1.  **`return { csv, rowCount, columnCount }`**: The function concludes by returning an object containing the generated `csv` string, `rowCount`, and `columnCount`.

**Simplified Logic:** Provides the final CSV text and its dimensions.

## 3. How to Use this Code

You would typically import and use these constants and the function like this:

```typescript
import {
  GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_MIME_TYPES,
  DEFAULT_EXPORT_FORMATS,
  SOURCE_MIME_TYPES,
  handleSheetsFormat,
} from './your-file-path'; // Adjust path as necessary

// Example 1: Using constants
console.log('Google Docs MIME Type:', GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_MIME_TYPES[0]);
console.log('Default export for Sheets:', DEFAULT_EXPORT_FORMATS['application/vnd.google-apps.spreadsheet']);
console.log('Source format for Slides:', SOURCE_MIME_TYPES['application/vnd.google-apps.presentation']);


// Example 2: Using handleSheetsFormat with an array of objects
const dataFromApi = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Alice', age: 30, city: 'New York' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Bob', age: 24, city: 'Los Angeles', status: 'Active' },
  { id: 3, name: 'Charlie', age: 35, city: 'Chicago', details: { occupation: 'Engineer', hobbies: ['reading', 'hiking'] } },
  null, // Example of mixed type / invalid row
  { id: 4, name: 'Diana', age: 29, city: 'Houston', details: { occupation: 'Designer', hobbies: ['painting', 'gaming'] } },
];

const result1 = handleSheetsFormat(dataFromApi);
console.log('CSV from array of objects:\n', result1.csv);
console.log('Rows:', result1.rowCount, 'Columns:', result1.columnCount);
// Expected CSV:
// id,name,age,city,status,details
// 1,Alice,30,New York,,
// 2,Bob,24,Los Angeles,Active,
// 3,Charlie,35,Chicago,,"{""occupation"":""Engineer"",""hobbies"":[""reading"",""hiking""]}"
// ,,,,,,
// 4,Diana,29,Houston,,"{""occupation"":""Designer"",""hobbies"":[""painting"",""gaming""]}"

// Example 3: Using handleSheetsFormat with an array of arrays
const simpleTable = [
  ['Header A', 'Header B', 'Header C'],
  [1, 'Value 1', true],
  [2, 'Value 2, with comma', false],
];

const result2 = handleSheetsFormat(simpleTable);
console.log('\nCSV from array of arrays:\n', result2.csv);
console.log('Rows:', result2.rowCount, 'Columns:', result2.columnCount);
// Expected CSV:
// Header A,Header B,Header C
// 1,Value 1,true
// 2,"Value 2, with comma",false

// Example 4: Using handleSheetsFormat with a raw CSV string
const rawCsv = `col1,col2\r\nval1,val2\r\nval3,val4`;
const result3 = handleSheetsFormat(rawCsv);
console.log('\nCSV from raw string:\n', result3.csv); // Direct return, no processing
console.log('Rows:', result3.rowCount, 'Columns:', result3.columnCount); // will be 0,0 since it was returned early

// Example 5: Using handleSheetsFormat with a JSON string representing an array of objects
const jsonString = JSON.stringify([
  { fruit: 'apple', color: 'red' },
  { fruit: 'banana', color: 'yellow' },
]);
const result4 = handleSheetsFormat(jsonString);
console.log('\nCSV from JSON string:\n', result4.csv);
console.log('Rows:', result4.rowCount, 'Columns:', result4.columnCount);

// Example 6: Invalid input
const invalidInput = { some: 'object' };
const result5 = handleSheetsFormat(invalidInput);
console.log('\nResult for invalid input:', result5); // { rowCount: 0, columnCount: 0 }
```
