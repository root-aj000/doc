This TypeScript file defines a comprehensive configuration for a "GitHub PR Reader" tool. This tool is designed to fetch detailed information about a specific GitHub Pull Request (PR), including its diff and the list of files that were changed.

Essentially, this file isn't directly *running* the GitHub API calls, but rather *describing* how such a tool should operate within a larger system (likely a plugin framework, an agent framework, or a generic API orchestrator). It specifies what inputs the tool needs, how to make the necessary API requests, how to process the raw responses, and what kind of structured output to expect.

Let's break down the code step by step.

---

### **1. Purpose of this File**

The primary purpose of this file is to configure a "GitHub PR Reader" tool. It acts as a blueprint, detailing:

*   **Identification:** A unique ID, name, description, and version for the tool.
*   **Input Parameters (`params`):** What information is required from the user or an automated system (like an LLM) to use this tool (e.g., repository owner, name, PR number, API key).
*   **API Request Details (`request`):** How to construct the primary API call to GitHub to get the initial PR details.
*   **Response Transformation (`transformResponse`):** How to process the initial API response, make *additional* API calls (to get the PR diff and files changed), and combine all this data into a structured, user-friendly output.
*   **Output Schema (`outputs`):** A description of the final structured data this tool will produce, making it easier for other parts of the system to understand and utilize the results.

In simple terms, it's a declarative way to tell a system: "Here's how to talk to GitHub to get a PR's full details."

---

### **2. Simplify Complex Logic (`transformResponse`)**

The most complex part of this configuration is the `transformResponse` function. Its job is not just to parse the initial API response but to *enrich* it by performing subsequent API calls.

**Simplified Logic for `transformResponse`:**

1.  **Get Initial PR Data:** When the main GitHub PR API call completes, `transformResponse` first parses this initial response to get basic PR information (like title, description, URLs, etc.).
2.  **Fetch the Diff:** Using a URL found in the initial PR data, it makes a *second* API call to GitHub specifically to get the raw text difference (the "diff") of the entire pull request.
3.  **Fetch Files Changed:** It then constructs a URL and makes a *third* API call to GitHub to get a list of all individual files that were modified in the PR, along with details about each file (additions, deletions, status, etc.).
4.  **Consolidate and Format:** Finally, it takes all this gathered information (initial PR data, diff text, and files changed list) and bundles it into a structured object. This object includes a human-readable summary string and detailed metadata, ready to be consumed by the system using this tool.

This multi-step fetching ensures that the tool provides a comprehensive view of the PR, not just its high-level summary.

### **3. Explain Each Line of Code**

```typescript
import type { PROperationParams, PullRequestResponse } from '@/tools/github/types'
import type { ToolConfig } from '@/tools/types'
```
*   **`import type { ... } from '...'`**: These lines import TypeScript type definitions.
*   `PROperationParams`: This type likely defines the structure of the input parameters required for a GitHub PR operation (e.g., `owner`, `repo`, `pullNumber`).
*   `PullRequestResponse`: This type probably describes the expected structure of the *final output* after the tool has processed all information from the GitHub API.
*   `ToolConfig`: This is a generic type that defines the overall structure for configuring *any* tool within the framework this code belongs to. It takes two generic parameters: the type for the tool's input parameters and the type for the tool's output response. These imports ensure type safety and provide clear documentation for the data structures used.

```typescript
export const prTool: ToolConfig<PROperationParams, PullRequestResponse> = {
```
*   **`export const prTool`**: Declares a constant named `prTool` and makes it available for other files to import. This constant holds the entire configuration for our GitHub PR reader tool.
*   **`: ToolConfig<PROperationParams, PullRequestResponse>`**: This is a type annotation. It specifies that `prTool` must conform to the `ToolConfig` interface.
    *   `PROperationParams`: The first generic type argument, indicating that the `params` property of `prTool` will be of this type.
    *   `PullRequestResponse`: The second generic type argument, indicating that the `outputs` and the return type of `transformResponse` will align with this type.

```typescript
  id: 'github_pr',
  name: 'GitHub PR Reader',
  description: 'Fetch PR details including diff and files changed',
  version: '1.0.0',
```
*   **`id: 'github_pr'`**: A unique identifier for this specific tool.
*   **`name: 'GitHub PR Reader'`**: A human-readable name for the tool.
*   **`description: 'Fetch PR details including diff and files changed'`**: A brief explanation of what the tool does.
*   **`version: '1.0.0'`**: The version number of this tool configuration.

```typescript
  params: {
    owner: {
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
      visibility: 'user-or-llm',
      description: 'Repository owner',
    },
    repo: {
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
      visibility: 'user-or-llm',
      description: 'Repository name',
    },
    pullNumber: {
      type: 'number',
      required: true,
      visibility: 'user-or-llm',
      description: 'Pull request number',
    },
    apiKey: {
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
      visibility: 'user-only',
      description: 'GitHub API token',
    },
  },
```
*   **`params: { ... }`**: This object defines the input parameters that the tool requires to function. Each property within `params` (`owner`, `repo`, `pullNumber`, `apiKey`) describes a single parameter.
    *   **`type: 'string' | 'number'`**: Specifies the data type of the parameter.
    *   **`required: true`**: Indicates that this parameter *must* be provided for the tool to execute.
    *   **`visibility: 'user-or-llm' | 'user-only'`**: This is a custom property, likely for an AI agent or a framework that distinguishes between input sources.
        *   `'user-or-llm'`: The parameter can be provided either by a human user or by an LLM (Large Language Model) if it's operating as an agent.
        *   `'user-only'`: This parameter (the API key) should only be provided by a human user for security reasons; an LLM should not directly generate or access it.
    *   **`description: '...'`**: A short explanation of what the parameter represents.

```typescript
  request: {
    url: (params) =>
      `https://api.github.com/repos/${params.owner}/${params.repo}/pulls/${params.pullNumber}`,
    method: 'GET',
    headers: (params) => ({
      Accept: 'application/vnd.github.v3+json',
      Authorization: `Bearer ${params.apiKey}`,
    }),
  },
```
*   **`request: { ... }`**: This object defines how to make the initial HTTP request to the GitHub API.
    *   **`url: (params) => '...'`**: A function that dynamically constructs the URL for the API call. It takes the `params` object (containing `owner`, `repo`, `pullNumber`) as an argument and uses template literals to embed these values into the GitHub API endpoint for a specific pull request.
    *   **`method: 'GET'`**: Specifies that this will be an HTTP GET request to retrieve data.
    *   **`headers: (params) => ({ ... })`**: A function that dynamically constructs the HTTP headers for the request.
        *   `Accept: 'application/vnd.github.v3+json'`: This header tells the GitHub API that we prefer to receive the response in the v3 JSON format.
        *   `Authorization: `Bearer ${params.apiKey}``: This header is crucial for authentication. It includes the `apiKey` (GitHub API token) provided in the `params`, prefixed with "Bearer", to authorize the request.

```typescript
  transformResponse: async (response) => {
    const pr = await response.json()
```
*   **`transformResponse: async (response) => { ... }`**: This is an asynchronous function responsible for processing the raw response from the initial GitHub API call and performing any further data enrichment.
    *   **`async`**: Indicates that this function will perform asynchronous operations (like `await`).
    *   **`(response)`**: The function receives the raw HTTP `Response` object from the initial `request` as its input.
    *   **`const pr = await response.json()`**: Reads the body of the initial HTTP `response` and parses it as JSON. This `pr` constant now holds the main data about the pull request from the first API call.

```typescript
    // Fetch the PR diff
    const diffResponse = await fetch(pr.diff_url)
    const _diff = await diffResponse.text()
```
*   **`// Fetch the PR diff`**: A comment indicating the purpose of the following lines.
*   **`const diffResponse = await fetch(pr.diff_url)`**: Makes another HTTP request using the `fetch` API. It uses `pr.diff_url`, which is a URL found within the `pr` object (from the initial API response) that points to the raw diff content of the pull request.
*   **`const _diff = await diffResponse.text()`**: Reads the body of the `diffResponse` and parses it as plain text. This `_diff` constant now holds the complete raw diff of the PR. (Note: The underscore `_` usually suggests a variable might not be directly used or is an intermediate value).

```typescript
    // Fetch files changed
    const filesResponse = await fetch(
      `https://api.github.com/repos/${pr.base.repo.owner.login}/${pr.base.repo.name}/pulls/${pr.number}/files`
    )
    const files = await filesResponse.json()
```
*   **`// Fetch files changed`**: A comment indicating the purpose.
*   **`const filesResponse = await fetch(...)`**: Makes a *third* HTTP request to get a list of files changed in the PR.
    *   The URL is constructed using various nested properties from the `pr` object (`pr.base.repo.owner.login`, `pr.base.repo.name`, `pr.number`) to target the specific "files" endpoint for that pull request.
*   **`const files = await filesResponse.json()`**: Reads the body of the `filesResponse` and parses it as JSON. This `files` constant now holds an array of objects, where each object describes a file changed in the PR.

```typescript
    // Create a human-readable content string
    const content = `PR #${pr.number}: "${pr.title}" (${pr.state}) - Created: ${pr.created_at}, Updated: ${pr.updated_at}
Description: ${pr.body || 'No description'}
Files changed: ${files.length}
URL: ${pr.html_url}`
```
*   **`// Create a human-readable content string`**: A comment explaining the next part.
*   **`const content = `...``**: A template literal creating a concise, human-readable summary string of the pull request. It interpolates various properties from the `pr` object (`number`, `title`, `state`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `body`, `html_url`) and the `files.length` into a multi-line string.
    *   `pr.body || 'No description'`: If `pr.body` is empty or null, it defaults to "No description".

```typescript
    return {
      success: true,
      output: {
        content,
        metadata: {
          number: pr.number,
          title: pr.title,
          state: pr.state,
          html_url: pr.html_url,
          diff_url: pr.diff_url,
          created_at: pr.created_at,
          updated_at: pr.updated_at,
          files: files.map((file: any) => ({
            filename: file.filename,
            additions: file.additions,
            deletions: file.deletions,
            changes: file.changes,
            patch: file.patch,
            blob_url: file.blob_url,
            raw_url: file.raw_url,
            status: file.status,
          })),
        },
      },
    }
  },
```
*   **`return { ... }`**: This object is the final structured output of the `transformResponse` function.
    *   **`success: true`**: Indicates that the operation was successful.
    *   **`output: { ... }`**: This object holds the actual data produced by the tool.
        *   **`content`**: The human-readable summary string created earlier.
        *   **`metadata: { ... }`**: A nested object containing more detailed, structured data about the PR.
            *   Properties like `number`, `title`, `state`, `html_url`, `diff_url`, `created_at`, `updated_at` are directly taken from the initial `pr` object.
            *   **`files: files.map((file: any) => ({ ... }))`**: This uses the `map` array method to transform the raw `files` array (obtained from the third API call) into a new array. For each `file` object in the original array, it extracts specific properties (`filename`, `additions`, `deletions`, `changes`, `patch`, `blob_url`, `raw_url`, `status`) and creates a new, cleaner object with just those properties. The `any` type here is a temporary workaround, ideally, `file` would be strongly typed.

```typescript
  outputs: {
    content: { type: 'string', description: 'Human-readable PR summary' },
    metadata: {
      type: 'object',
      description: 'Detailed PR metadata including file changes',
      properties: {
        // ... (details for each metadata property) ...
      },
    },
  },
```
*   **`outputs: { ... }`**: This object defines the *schema* or expected structure of the data that the tool will *return*. It's a declarative way to document the shape of the `output` object returned by `transformResponse`. This is helpful for other parts of the system to understand what data they can expect.
    *   **`content: { type: 'string', description: 'Human-readable PR summary' }`**: Describes the `content` field.
    *   **`metadata: { ... }`**: Describes the `metadata` field.
        *   **`type: 'object'`**: Specifies that `metadata` is an object.
        *   **`description: 'Detailed PR metadata including file changes'`**: Explains what `metadata` contains.
        *   **`properties: { ... }`**: This nested object defines each property expected within the `metadata` object.
            *   Each property (`number`, `title`, `state`, `html_url`, `diff_url`, `created_at`, `updated_at`) is described with its `type` (e.g., `'number'`, `'string'`) and a `description`.
            *   **`files: { ... }`**: Describes the `files` array within `metadata`.
                *   **`type: 'array'`**: Indicates `files` is an array.
                *   **`description: 'Files changed in the PR'`**: Explains the array's content.
                *   **`items: { ... }`**: Defines the schema for each individual item *within* the `files` array.
                    *   **`type: 'object'`**: Each item is an object.
                    *   **`properties: { ... }`**: Defines the properties of each file object (`filename`, `additions`, `deletions`, `changes`, `patch`, `blob_url`, `raw_url`, `status`), each with its `type` and `description`. This precisely mirrors the structure created in the `files.map` within `transformResponse`.

```typescript
}
```
*   **`}`**: Closes the `prTool` constant declaration.
