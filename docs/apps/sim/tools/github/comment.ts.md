This TypeScript file defines a `ToolConfig` object named `commentTool`. This object acts as a blueprint or configuration for a specialized tool designed to interact with the GitHub API, specifically to *create comments on Pull Requests (PRs)*.

Think of it as setting up a miniature application or a function that knows exactly how to talk to GitHub to post comments, whether they are general comments on a PR or specific comments on a file's diff. This `ToolConfig` structure is likely used by an overarching system (e.g., an AI agent, an automation platform, or a custom backend) that can dynamically understand and execute various "tools."

## Detailed Explanation

Let's break down the code section by section.

---

### Imports

```typescript
import type { CreateCommentParams, CreateCommentResponse } from '@/tools/github/types'
import type { ToolConfig } from '@/tools/types'
```

These lines import necessary TypeScript types:

*   **`CreateCommentParams`**: This type defines the expected *input parameters* for our GitHub comment tool. It tells us what information we need to provide when we want to create a comment (e.g., repository owner, body of the comment, PR number).
*   **`CreateCommentResponse`**: This type defines the expected *output structure* when the GitHub API successfully creates a comment. It tells us what kind of data we'll get back (e.g., the comment's ID, its URL).
    *   Both `CreateCommentParams` and `CreateCommentResponse` likely come from a file named `types.ts` within a `github` subdirectory, indicating specific types related to GitHub interactions.
*   **`ToolConfig`**: This is a generic type that provides a standardized structure for defining any "tool." It specifies how a tool's ID, name, description, input parameters, request logic, and response handling should be structured. The `<CreateCommentParams, CreateCommentResponse>` part indicates that this specific `ToolConfig` expects `CreateCommentParams` as its input and will produce `CreateCommentResponse` as its output.
    *   This type likely comes from a more general `types.ts` file within a `tools` directory, suggesting a system that manages multiple such tools.

---

### Tool Configuration Object: `commentTool`

```typescript
export const commentTool: ToolConfig<CreateCommentParams, CreateCommentResponse> = {
  // ... (rest of the configuration)
}
```

This line declares and exports `commentTool`, a constant that holds the entire configuration for our GitHub PR commenter tool. It's explicitly typed as `ToolConfig` with the specific input and output types we just discussed.

---

### Basic Tool Metadata

```typescript
  id: 'github_comment',
  name: 'GitHub PR Commenter',
  description: 'Create comments on GitHub PRs',
  version: '1.0.0',
```

These properties provide basic identification and description for the tool:

*   **`id`**: A unique identifier for this tool, typically used programmatically (e.g., to look up the tool by name).
*   **`name`**: A human-readable name for the tool, useful for display in a UI or logs.
*   **`description`**: A brief explanation of what the tool does, helping users or other systems understand its purpose.
*   **`version`**: The version number of this specific tool configuration, useful for tracking changes.

---

### Parameters Definition: `params`

```typescript
  params: {
    owner: { /* ... */ },
    repo: { /* ... */ },
    body: { /* ... */ },
    pullNumber: { /* ... */ },
    path: { /* ... */ },
    position: { /* ... */ },
    commentType: { /* ... */ },
    line: { /* ... */ },
    side: { /* ... */ },
    commitId: { /* ... */ },
    apiKey: { /* ... */ },
  },
```

This `params` object is crucial. It defines *all the possible inputs* that the `commentTool` can accept, along with their types, requirements, and how they should be treated. Each property within `params` (like `owner`, `repo`, `body`) is an individual input parameter for the tool.

For each parameter, the following properties are defined:

*   **`type`**: The data type of the parameter (e.g., `'string'`, `'number'`).
*   **`required`**: A boolean indicating if this parameter *must* be provided for the tool to function (`true`) or if it's optional (`false`).
*   **`visibility`**: This is a key concept for tools that might be used by both humans and AI models (like LLMs). It dictates who is expected to provide or see this parameter:
    *   **`'user-or-llm'`**: Either a human user or an AI/LLM agent can provide this value. These are typically the common, non-sensitive inputs.
    *   **`'user-only'`**: Only a human user should provide this value. This is typically used for sensitive information like API keys, which shouldn't be exposed directly to an LLM for security reasons.
    *   **`'hidden'`**: This parameter is internal and should not be exposed to either users or LLMs. It might be calculated internally or have a fixed default that doesn't need to be configurable.
*   **`description`**: A human-readable explanation of what the parameter is for.
*   **`default`**: An optional default value that will be used if the parameter is not explicitly provided.

Let's look at each parameter:

*   **`owner`**:
    *   `type: 'string'`, `required: true`, `visibility: 'user-or-llm'`.
    *   Description: The GitHub username or organization name that owns the repository (e.g., `octocat`).
*   **`repo`**:
    *   `type: 'string'`, `required: true`, `visibility: 'user-or-llm'`.
    *   Description: The name of the repository (e.g., `Hello-World`).
*   **`body`**:
    *   `type: 'string'`, `required: true`, `visibility: 'user-or-llm'`.
    *   Description: The actual text content of the comment.
*   **`pullNumber`**:
    *   `type: 'number'`, `required: true`, `visibility: 'user-or-llm'`.
    *   Description: The unique number identifying the Pull Request on which the comment will be made.
*   **`path`**:
    *   `type: 'string'`, `required: false`, `visibility: 'user-or-llm'`.
    *   Description: The file path if the comment is a *review comment* on a specific file (e.g., `src/main.ts`). If this is provided, it indicates a "file comment."
*   **`position`**:
    *   `type: 'number'`, `required: false`, `visibility: 'hidden'`.
    *   Description: The line index in the diff for a review comment. This is the 0-indexed position within the *diff* itself, not the original file line number. It's `hidden` because it's often more complex to calculate and `line` might be preferred by users.
*   **`commentType`**:
    *   `type: 'string'`, `required: false`, `visibility: 'user-or-llm'`.
    *   Description: A string to differentiate between a general PR comment (`pr_comment`) and a comment specific to a file's diff (`file_comment`). This helps the `request` logic determine which GitHub API endpoint and payload to use.
*   **`line`**:
    *   `type: 'number'`, `required: false`, `visibility: 'hidden'`.
    *   Description: The specific line number in the file for a review comment. This is the line in the *new* version of the file (RIGHT side of the diff). `hidden` often because `position` (diff index) is sometimes used internally.
*   **`side`**:
    *   `type: 'string'`, `required: false`, `visibility: 'hidden'`, `default: 'RIGHT'`.
    *   Description: For review comments, specifies which side of the diff the comment refers to: `'LEFT'` (original file) or `'RIGHT'` (new file). Defaults to `'RIGHT'`.
*   **`commitId`**:
    *   `type: 'string'`, `required: false`, `visibility: 'hidden'`.
    *   Description: The SHA (hash) of the commit to which the comment applies. This is crucial for file-specific comments to pinpoint the exact version of the file being commented on.
*   **`apiKey`**:
    *   `type: 'string'`, `required: true`, `visibility: 'user-only'`.
    *   Description: The personal access token (PAT) for authenticating with the GitHub API. This is marked `user-only` for security, meaning an LLM should not directly see or generate this value.

### Request Definition: `request`

```typescript
  request: {
    url: (params) => { /* ... */ },
    method: 'POST',
    headers: (params) => ({ /* ... */ }),
    body: (params) => { /* ... */ },
  },
```

This `request` object defines *how* the tool should make its HTTP call to the GitHub API, including the URL, method, headers, and request body. The functions `url`, `headers`, and `body` are dynamic, meaning they generate their respective values based on the `params` provided to the tool.

*   **`url`**: A function that constructs the API endpoint URL dynamically:

    ```typescript
    url: (params) => {
      if (params.path) {
        // If 'path' is provided, it's a file-specific review comment
        return `https://api.github.com/repos/${params.owner}/${params.repo}/pulls/${params.pullNumber}/comments`
      }
      // Otherwise, it's a general PR review comment
      return `https://api.github.com/repos/${params.owner}/${params.repo}/pulls/${params.pullNumber}/reviews`
    },
    ```

    *   This logic distinguishes between two types of comments:
        *   If `params.path` (a file path) is provided, it means we want to comment on a specific line of a specific file within the PR. The endpoint used is `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}/comments`.
        *   If `params.path` is *not* provided, it's considered a general comment on the entire Pull Request. The endpoint used is `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}/reviews`. This endpoint is typically used to submit a "review" that can include an overall comment.

*   **`method`**:

    ```typescript
    method: 'POST',
    ```

    *   Both creating a file-specific comment and submitting a general review with a comment are done via an HTTP `POST` request.

*   **`headers`**: A function that generates the HTTP headers for the request:

    ```typescript
    headers: (params) => ({
      Accept: 'application/vnd.github.v3+json',
      Authorization: `Bearer ${params.apiKey}`,
      'X-GitHub-Api-Version': '2022-11-28',
    }),
    ```

    *   **`Accept: 'application/vnd.github.v3+json'`**: This header tells the GitHub API that we prefer version 3 of their API and expect a JSON response.
    *   **`Authorization: `Bearer ${params.apiKey}``**: This is for authentication. It uses the `apiKey` provided in the `params` to include a Bearer token, authorizing the request with the user's GitHub credentials.
    *   **`X-GitHub-Api-Version: '2022-11-28'`**: This header explicitly requests a specific version of the GitHub API, ensuring consistent behavior.

*   **`body`**: A function that constructs the JSON request body dynamically:

    ```typescript
    body: (params) => {
      if (params.commentType === 'file_comment') {
        // Body for a file-specific review comment
        return {
          body: params.body,
          commit_id: params.commitId,
          path: params.path,
          line: params.line || params.position, // Use 'line' if available, otherwise 'position'
          side: params.side || 'RIGHT', // Use 'side' if available, otherwise default to 'RIGHT'
        }
      }
      // Body for a general PR review comment
      return {
        body: params.body,
        event: 'COMMENT', // Indicates that this review contains a single comment
      }
    },
    ```

    *   This logic mirrors the `url` logic, constructing different request bodies based on whether it's a file-specific comment or a general PR comment:
        *   If `params.commentType` is `'file_comment'` (or implicitly if `params.path` was set, as `commentType` would likely be inferred or set): The body includes the comment `body`, the `commit_id`, the `path` of the file, the `line` number (falling back to `position` if `line` isn't provided), and the `side` of the diff (falling back to `'RIGHT'`).
        *   Otherwise (for a general PR comment): The body simply includes the comment `body` and an `event` of `'COMMENT'`. This `event` signifies that the review being submitted is solely a comment.

### Response Transformation: `transformResponse`

```typescript
  transformResponse: async (response) => {
    const data = await response.json()

    // Create a human-readable content string
    const content = `Comment created: "${data.body}"`

    return {
      success: true,
      output: {
        content,
        metadata: {
          id: data.id,
          html_url: data.html_url,
          created_at: data.created_at,
          updated_at: data.updated_at,
          path: data.path,
          line: data.line || data.position, // Again, handle line/position fallback
          side: data.side,
          commit_id: data.commit_id,
        },
      },
    }
  },
```

This asynchronous function is responsible for taking the raw HTTP response from the GitHub API and transforming it into a standardized, usable output format for our tool.

*   **`const data = await response.json()`**: The first step is to parse the raw HTTP response body, which is expected to be in JSON format, into a JavaScript object.
*   **`const content = `Comment created: "${data.body}"``**: A simple, human-readable string is created to confirm the action and include a snippet of the comment's body. This `content` is designed for quick user feedback.
*   **`return { success: true, output: { ... } }`**: The function returns a structured object indicating the success of the operation and the actual output.
    *   **`success: true`**: A boolean flag indicating that the tool executed successfully.
    *   **`output`**: This object holds the actual results from the tool:
        *   **`content`**: The human-readable confirmation string we just created.
        *   **`metadata`**: An object containing more detailed, raw, or slightly processed data from the GitHub API response. This includes:
            *   `id`: The unique ID of the created comment.
            *   `html_url`: The URL where the comment can be viewed on GitHub.
            *   `created_at`, `updated_at`: Timestamps of when the comment was created and last updated.
            *   `path`, `line`, `side`, `commit_id`: These fields are included if the comment was file-specific, echoing back the details used or inferred during creation. The `line` property again handles the fallback from `data.position`.

---

### Outputs Definition: `outputs`

```typescript
  outputs: {
    content: { type: 'string', description: 'Human-readable comment confirmation' },
    metadata: {
      type: 'object',
      description: 'Comment metadata',
    },
  },
```

This `outputs` object formally declares the structure of the data that the `transformResponse` function will produce. It acts as a contract for what other parts of the system can expect from this tool's output.

*   **`content`**:
    *   `type: 'string'`, `description: 'Human-readable comment confirmation'`.
    *   This tells us the `content` property in the output will be a string, providing a brief confirmation.
*   **`metadata`**:
    *   `type: 'object'`, `description: 'Comment metadata'`.
    *   This indicates that the `metadata` property will be an object containing detailed information about the created comment. While it doesn't list all the sub-properties (like `id`, `html_url`), it signifies that a structured object of metadata is expected.

---

## Simplified Complex Logic

1.  **Conditional GitHub API Endpoints:** The tool intelligently decides which GitHub API endpoint to hit based on whether you're trying to leave a general comment on a PR or a specific comment on a line of code within a file.
    *   If `path` (file path) is provided, it uses the `/comments` endpoint for file-specific remarks.
    *   Otherwise, it uses the `/reviews` endpoint to submit a general review comment.
2.  **Dynamic Request Bodies:** Similarly, the content of the HTTP request sent to GitHub changes based on the type of comment:
    *   For file-specific comments, the body includes `commit_id`, `path`, `line`, and `side` to pinpoint the exact location in the code.
    *   For general PR comments, it simply includes the `body` of the comment and specifies `event: 'COMMENT'`.
3.  **Secure API Key Handling:** The `apiKey` is marked `user-only` in the `params` definition, indicating that this sensitive credential should only be provided by a human user and not exposed to an AI model directly. This is a crucial security consideration.
4.  **Standardized Output:** Regardless of the type of comment or the GitHub API's raw response, the `transformResponse` function always converts the result into a consistent `success` / `output` structure, providing both a simple human-readable `content` string and detailed `metadata` for programmatic use. This makes it easy for the consuming system to handle results from various tools uniformly.
5.  **Line/Position Fallback:** For file-specific comments, there's a flexible way to specify the line number using either `line` or `position` in the input, and the tool intelligently uses whichever is available (prioritizing `line`). This fallback is also applied when processing the response to maintain consistency.

In essence, `commentTool` is a robust, pre-configured module that encapsulates all the complexity of interacting with the GitHub API for PR comments, making it easy for a higher-level system to "call" this tool with simple parameters and get back a predictable, useful result.
