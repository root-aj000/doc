This TypeScript file is a set of **type definitions** (interfaces) designed to bring type safety and clarity to interactions with the Eleven Labs Text-to-Speech (TTS) API within a larger application.

In essence, it acts as a blueprint, specifying the exact shape of data that goes *into* a request to Eleven Labs TTS and the data that is expected to come *out* of a successful response.

---

## Purpose of this File

The primary purposes of this file are:

1.  **Type Safety:** By defining these interfaces, TypeScript can check your code at compile-time. This means if you try to call an Eleven Labs TTS function with missing parameters or use a response property that doesn't exist, TypeScript will immediately flag an error, preventing common runtime bugs.
2.  **Code Readability and Documentation:** These interfaces serve as clear, self-documenting contracts. Anyone looking at your code instantly understands what data is required for an Eleven Labs TTS request (`ElevenLabsTtsParams`) and what kind of data to expect back (`ElevenLabsTtsResponse`).
3.  **Consistency:** They ensure that all parts of your application interacting with Eleven Labs TTS use the same data structures, reducing inconsistencies and integration issues.
4.  **Modularity:** By importing `ToolResponse`, it indicates this file is part of a system that handles various "tools" or external integrations, providing a consistent base for all tool responses.

## Simplifying Complex Logic (Interfaces & Type Inheritance)

While the code itself doesn't contain complex *runtime* logic (like algorithms or conditional statements), the "complexity" for someone new to TypeScript might be understanding *why* and *how* interfaces and type inheritance (using `extends`) are used.

1.  **Interfaces as Contracts/Blueprints:**
    Imagine you're building a house. An interface is like a **blueprint** for a specific part of that house (e.g., the "Kitchen Plan" or "Bathroom Plan"). It doesn't *build* the house, but it strictly defines what elements must be present (sink, stove, toilet, shower) and their types (e.g., sink must be a `CeramicSink` type, not a `PlasticBowl`).
    In our code, `ElevenLabsTtsParams` is the blueprint for *sending* data to Eleven Labs, and `ElevenLabsTtsResponse` is the blueprint for *receiving* data.

2.  **`extends` for Reusing Blueprints (Type Inheritance):**
    Now, imagine you have a general "Tool Response Plan" blueprint (`ToolResponse`). This plan might define common things like `status` or `errors` that *all* tool responses should have, regardless of the specific tool (Eleven Labs, OpenAI, etc.).
    When you create `ElevenLabsTtsResponse`, instead of redefining those common `ToolResponse` elements, you simply say `extends ToolResponse`. This means: "My `ElevenLabsTtsResponse` blueprint is exactly like the `ToolResponse` blueprint, PLUS it has these specific things for Eleven Labs TTS."
    This reuses common definitions, makes your code more organized, and ensures consistency across different tool integrations.

## Explanation of Each Line of Code

Let's break down each line and concept:

### `import type { ToolResponse } from '@/tools/types'`

*   **`import type`**: This is a special TypeScript import that signals that you are only importing `ToolResponse` for **type checking purposes**. It means that `ToolResponse` will *not* exist in the compiled JavaScript output, ensuring zero runtime overhead. It's purely for helping TypeScript understand the shape of your data during development.
*   **`{ ToolResponse }`**: This specifies that you are importing a named export called `ToolResponse`.
*   **`from '@/tools/types'`**: This is the path to the file where `ToolResponse` is defined. The `@/` is likely an alias configured in your `tsconfig.json` or bundler (like Webpack/Vite) that points to a specific directory (e.g., `src/`), making imports cleaner. This tells us that `ToolResponse` is a generic type used across different tools in your application.

### `export interface ElevenLabsTtsParams {`

*   **`export`**: This keyword makes the `ElevenLabsTtsParams` interface available for other files in your project to import and use.
*   **`interface`**: This declares a TypeScript interface. An interface defines a contract for the shape of an object. It describes the names of properties an object should have, and the types of their values.
*   **`ElevenLabsTtsParams`**: This is the name of our interface, standing for "Eleven Labs Text-to-Speech Parameters." This interface defines the data structure required when making a request to the Eleven Labs TTS service.
*   **`{`**: Opens the definition of the interface.

### `apiKey: string`

*   **`apiKey`**: This defines a property named `apiKey`.
*   **`: string`**: This specifies that the `apiKey` property *must* be a value of type `string`. This key is essential for authenticating with the Eleven Labs API.

### `text: string`

*   **`text`**: Defines a property named `text`.
*   **`: string`**: Specifies that `text` must be a `string`. This is the actual text that you want the Eleven Labs service to convert into speech.

### `voiceId: string`

*   **`voiceId`**: Defines a property named `voiceId`.
*   **`: string`**: Specifies that `voiceId` must be a `string`. This identifies which specific voice (e.g., male, female, specific accent) should be used for the text-to-speech conversion.

### `modelId?: string`

*   **`modelId`**: Defines an optional property named `modelId`.
*   **`?`**: The question mark signifies that this property is **optional**. An object conforming to `ElevenLabsTtsParams` *may or may not* include `modelId`. If it's present, its value must be a `string`.
*   **`: string`**: Specifies that if `modelId` is provided, it must be a `string`. This allows you to specify which particular TTS model Eleven Labs should use (e.g., a standard model, a high-quality model, a specific language model).

### `}`

*   Closes the definition of the `ElevenLabsTtsParams` interface.

### `export interface ElevenLabsTtsResponse extends ToolResponse {`

*   **`export interface ElevenLabsTtsResponse`**: Similar to `ElevenLabsTtsParams`, this exports an interface named `ElevenLabsTtsResponse`, which defines the expected structure of a successful response *from* the Eleven Labs TTS service.
*   **`extends ToolResponse`**: This is the key part of type inheritance. It means that `ElevenLabsTtsResponse` will inherit all the properties defined in the `ToolResponse` interface. So, an `ElevenLabsTtsResponse` object will *at least* have all the properties of `ToolResponse`, plus any new ones defined within this interface. This is crucial for maintaining a consistent response structure across different "tools" in your system.
*   **`{`**: Opens the definition.

### `output: {`

*   **`output`**: Defines a property named `output`. This is an object that will contain the actual result data specific to the Eleven Labs TTS operation. This pattern (wrapping the specific result in an `output` object) is common for larger API responses to provide a clear separation of metadata (from `ToolResponse`) and core data.
*   **`{`**: Opens the definition of the `output` object.

### `audioUrl: string`

*   **`audioUrl`**: Defines a property named `audioUrl` *within the `output` object*.
*   **`: string`**: Specifies that `audioUrl` must be a `string`. This string will be the URL where the generated audio file can be downloaded or streamed.

### `}` (closing `output` object)

*   Closes the definition of the `output` object.

### `}` (closing `ElevenLabsTtsResponse` interface)

*   Closes the definition of the `ElevenLabsTtsResponse` interface.

### `export interface ElevenLabsBlockResponse extends ToolResponse {`

*   **`export interface ElevenLabsBlockResponse`**: This exports another interface, `ElevenLabsBlockResponse`.
*   **`extends ToolResponse`**: Just like `ElevenLabsTtsResponse`, this interface also extends `ToolResponse`, inheriting its common properties.
*   **`{`**: Opens the definition.
*   **`output: { audioUrl: string }`**: This defines an `output` object with an `audioUrl` string property, which is **identical** in structure to `ElevenLabsTtsResponse`.
*   **Interpretation**: The existence of `ElevenLabsBlockResponse` with an identical structure to `ElevenLabsTtsResponse` suggests a few possibilities:
    1.  **Semantic Distinction:** They might represent responses from different *types* of Eleven Labs TTS operations (e.g., a "TTS stream" response vs. a "TTS block/file" response), even if their immediate output is the same.
    2.  **Future Divergence:** One of these interfaces might be intended to evolve differently in the future, with additional properties specific to its use case.
    3.  **Alias/Historical:** One might simply be an alias or a leftover from a previous iteration, effectively serving the same purpose for now.
    Regardless, both explicitly define an `audioUrl` as the primary output.
*   **`}`**: Closes the definition of the `output` object.
*   **`}`**: Closes the definition of the `ElevenLabsBlockResponse` interface.

## In Summary

This file is a well-structured example of using TypeScript interfaces to define clear, type-safe contracts for interacting with an external API (Eleven Labs TTS). It leverages `import type` for zero-runtime overhead type definitions and `extends` for building upon common base types (`ToolResponse`), promoting code consistency and maintainability across a larger application.
