This TypeScript file defines a configuration for a "website scraping" tool that leverages the Firecrawl API. It's designed to be a plug-and-play definition for a system (likely an AI agent or a custom application framework) that can utilize external tools.

Essentially, this file tells the system:
1.  **What this tool is:** Its name, description, and purpose.
2.  **What inputs it needs:** The URL to scrape, an optional API key, and optional scraping options.
3.  **How to use it:** The specific HTTP request (method, URL, headers, body) to send to the Firecrawl API.
4.  **How to interpret its results:** How to process the raw API response and what structured outputs to expect (markdown, HTML, metadata).

Let's break down the code in detail.

### File Purpose: Defining a Firecrawl Website Scraper Tool

This file's primary purpose is to define a **`ToolConfig`** object for a website scraping tool using the Firecrawl API. In a system that can integrate various "tools" (like an AI assistant framework or a microservice orchestrator), this configuration acts as a blueprint. It describes everything needed to:
*   Present the tool to a user or another AI (e.g., its name, description).
*   Validate the inputs required to use the tool.
*   Construct the actual API call to the Firecrawl service.
*   Process the API's response into a useful, structured output for the consuming system.

The core idea is to encapsulate all the necessary information about how to interact with the Firecrawl API's scrape endpoint into a single, self-contained, and type-safe configuration object.

### Line-by-Line Explanation

```typescript
import type { ScrapeParams, ScrapeResponse } from '@/tools/firecrawl/types'
import type { ToolConfig } from '@/tools/types'
```
*   **`import type { ScrapeParams, ScrapeResponse } from '@/tools/firecrawl/types'`**: This line imports two TypeScript types, `ScrapeParams` and `ScrapeResponse`. These types define the structure of the *input parameters* expected by the Firecrawl scraping tool and the structure of the *output response* returned by it, respectively. The `@/tools/firecrawl/types` path indicates that these types are defined in a separate file, likely within a module related to Firecrawl tools.
*   **`import type { ToolConfig } from '@/tools/types'`**: This line imports the `ToolConfig` type. This is a generic type that defines the overall structure for *any* tool configuration within the system. It expects two generic arguments: the type for the tool's parameters and the type for the tool's response. This ensures all tools adhere to a consistent interface.

```typescript
export const scrapeTool: ToolConfig<ScrapeParams, ScrapeResponse> = {
```
*   **`export const scrapeTool:`**: This declares a constant variable named `scrapeTool` and makes it available for other files to import and use (`export`).
*   **`ToolConfig<ScrapeParams, ScrapeResponse>`**: This is the type annotation for `scrapeTool`. It specifies that `scrapeTool` must conform to the `ToolConfig` interface, and it's specialized with `ScrapeParams` as its input parameter type and `ScrapeResponse` as its output response type. This provides strong type checking throughout the configuration.
*   **`=`**: This assigns the object definition that follows to the `scrapeTool` constant.

```typescript
  id: 'firecrawl_scrape',
  name: 'Firecrawl Website Scraper',
  description:
    'Extract structured content from web pages with comprehensive metadata support. Converts content to markdown or HTML while capturing SEO metadata, Open Graph tags, and page information.',
  version: '1.0.0',
```
*   **`id: 'firecrawl_scrape'`**: A unique identifier for this specific tool. This `id` is used internally by the system to reference or invoke this tool.
*   **`name: 'Firecrawl Website Scraper'`**: A human-readable name for the tool, typically used in user interfaces or AI prompts.
*   **`description: '...'`**: A detailed, human-readable explanation of what the tool does. This is crucial for users or AI models to understand the tool's capabilities and decide when to use it.
*   **`version: '1.0.0'`**: The version number of this tool configuration. Useful for managing updates and compatibility.

```typescript
  params: {
    url: {
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
      visibility: 'user-or-llm',
      description: 'The URL to scrape content from',
    },
    scrapeOptions: {
      type: 'json',
      required: false,
      visibility: 'hidden',
      description: 'Options for content scraping',
    },
    apiKey: {
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
      visibility: 'user-only',
      description: 'Firecrawl API key',
    },
  },
```
*   **`params: { ... }`**: This object defines all the input parameters (arguments) that the tool expects. Each key within `params` represents a single parameter.
    *   **`url: { ... }`**: Defines the `url` parameter.
        *   **`type: 'string'`**: Specifies that the `url` must be a string.
        *   **`required: true`**: Indicates that this parameter is mandatory; the tool cannot be used without providing a URL.
        *   **`visibility: 'user-or-llm'`**: This is a key configuration for tools, especially in AI agent contexts. It means this parameter can be provided either directly by a human user or generated/inferred by a Large Language Model (LLM) that's using the tool.
        *   **`description: 'The URL to scrape content from'`**: A description for the `url` parameter, explaining its purpose.
    *   **`scrapeOptions: { ... }`**: Defines the `scrapeOptions` parameter.
        *   **`type: 'json'`**: Specifies that `scrapeOptions` should be a JSON object (or string that can be parsed as JSON).
        *   **`required: false`**: This parameter is optional.
        *   **`visibility: 'hidden'`**: This means the `scrapeOptions` parameter is *not* typically exposed to a human user or an LLM. It's likely an internal configuration or a way for advanced users to pass specific Firecrawl options directly, without being prompted for it.
        *   **`description: 'Options for content scraping'`**: A description for the `scrapeOptions` parameter.
    *   **`apiKey: { ... }`**: Defines the `apiKey` parameter.
        *   **`type: 'string'`**: Specifies that the `apiKey` must be a string.
        *   **`required: true`**: The API key is mandatory for authentication with Firecrawl.
        *   **`visibility: 'user-only'`**: This is important for sensitive information. It means the `apiKey` should *only* be provided by the human user (e.g., from a secure environment variable, a settings page, or a one-time input). An LLM should *not* be able to generate or see this value directly.
        *   **`description: 'Firecrawl API key'`**: A description for the `apiKey` parameter.

```typescript
  request: {
    method: 'POST',
    url: 'https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/scrape',
    headers: (params) => ({
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      Authorization: `Bearer ${params.apiKey}`,
    }),
    body: (params) => ({
      url: params.url,
      formats: params.scrapeOptions?.formats || ['markdown'],
    }),
  },
```
*   **`request: { ... }`**: This object describes how to construct the actual HTTP request to the Firecrawl API.
    *   **`method: 'POST'`**: The HTTP method to use for the request. Scraping usually involves sending data (like the URL) to an endpoint, so POST is appropriate.
    *   **`url: 'https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/scrape'`**: The specific API endpoint to call for scraping.
    *   **`headers: (params) => ({ ... })`**: This is a function that takes the `params` (the inputs provided to the tool) and returns an object representing the HTTP headers.
        *   **`'Content-Type': 'application/json'`**: Standard header indicating that the request body will be in JSON format.
        *   **`Authorization: \`Bearer ${params.apiKey}\``**: This is for authentication. It dynamically constructs the `Authorization` header using the `apiKey` provided in the `params`. This tells the Firecrawl API who is making the request.
    *   **`body: (params) => ({ ... })`**: This is another function that takes the `params` and returns an object representing the JSON body of the HTTP request.
        *   **`url: params.url`**: Populates the `url` field in the request body with the `url` parameter provided to the tool.
        *   **`formats: params.scrapeOptions?.formats || ['markdown']`**: This sets the desired output formats for the scraped content.
            *   `params.scrapeOptions?.formats`: It attempts to get the `formats` property from the `scrapeOptions` parameter. The `?.` (optional chaining) safely handles cases where `scrapeOptions` might be undefined or null.
            *   `|| ['markdown']`: If `params.scrapeOptions?.formats` is not provided or is falsy, it defaults to `['markdown']`, meaning the tool will request the content in markdown format by default.

```typescript
  transformResponse: async (response: Response) => {
    const data = await response.json()

    return {
      success: true,
      output: {
        markdown: data.data.markdown,
        html: data.data.html,
        metadata: data.data.metadata,
      },
    }
  },
```
*   **`transformResponse: async (response: Response) => { ... }`**: This is an asynchronous function responsible for processing the raw HTTP response received from the Firecrawl API into a standardized, structured output that the consuming system can easily use.
    *   **`async`**: Indicates that this is an asynchronous function, meaning it can perform operations that take time, like `await`.
    *   **`(response: Response)`**: It takes a `Response` object (the standard Web API Response object from `fetch`) as its input.
    *   **`const data = await response.json()`**: The `response.json()` method parses the response body as JSON. Since this is an asynchronous operation, `await` is used to pause execution until the parsing is complete, and the resulting JavaScript object is stored in the `data` constant.
    *   **`return { ... }`**: The function returns a specific object structure.
        *   **`success: true`**: A boolean flag indicating that the tool execution was successful. (Error handling would typically set this to `false` and include an error message).
        *   **`output: { ... }`**: This object contains the actual structured data extracted from the API response.
            *   **`markdown: data.data.markdown`**: Extracts the markdown content from the Firecrawl response (assuming the API response has a structure like `response.data.markdown`).
            *   **`html: data.data.html`**: Extracts the HTML content.
            *   **`metadata: data.data.metadata`**: Extracts the page metadata (SEO, Open Graph, etc.).

```typescript
  outputs: {
    markdown: { type: 'string', description: 'Page content in markdown format' },
    html: { type: 'string', description: 'Raw HTML content of the page' },
    metadata: {
      type: 'object',
      description: 'Page metadata including SEO and Open Graph information',
    },
  },
}
```
*   **`outputs: { ... }`**: This object defines the structured output that this tool will produce *after* `transformResponse` has processed the API data. This is useful for the consuming system to understand what data it will receive and for type-checking.
    *   **`markdown: { ... }`**: Describes the `markdown` output.
        *   **`type: 'string'`**: Specifies that `markdown` will be a string.
        *   **`description: 'Page content in markdown format'`**: A description of the markdown output.
    *   **`html: { ... }`**: Describes the `html` output.
        *   **`type: 'string'`**: Specifies that `html` will be a string.
        *   **`description: 'Raw HTML content of the page'`**: A description of the HTML output.
    *   **`metadata: { ... }`**: Describes the `metadata` output.
        *   **`type: 'object'`**: Specifies that `metadata` will be a JavaScript object.
        *   **`description: 'Page metadata including SEO and Open Graph information'`**: A description of the metadata output.
