This TypeScript file is a collection of **interface and type definitions** designed to structure data related to interactions with the Discord API. Think of it as a comprehensive dictionary or blueprint that dictates the exact shape and types of data you'll send to or receive from Discord (or a service built on top of Discord).

---

### **Purpose of this File**

The primary purpose of this file is to provide **type safety and clarity** when working with Discord-related data in a TypeScript project.

1.  **Data Structure Definition:** It clearly defines the structure of various Discord entities like messages, guilds (servers), users, and API errors.
2.  **API Request/Response Schemas:** It specifies the expected parameters for making requests to a Discord API (e.g., `DiscordSendMessageParams`) and the expected format of the responses (e.g., `DiscordSendMessageResponse`).
3.  **Readability and Maintainability:** By having these explicit types, developers can understand exactly what data is available, what is required, and what is optional, reducing bugs and making the codebase easier to maintain.
4.  **Autocompletion and Error Checking:** In a TypeScript-aware editor, these definitions enable powerful autocompletion and compile-time error checking, catching many potential issues before the code even runs.

In essence, this file acts as the "contract" between your application and the Discord API, ensuring consistent and predictable data handling.

### **Simplifying Complex Logic**

Let's break down some TypeScript concepts used here that might seem complex:

*   **`export`**: This keyword makes the interface or type available for use in other TypeScript files. Without `export`, it would only be usable within this file.
*   **`interface`**: Interfaces are a core feature of TypeScript for defining the *shape* of objects. They act like a contract: if an object claims to implement an interface, it must have all the properties (and their specified types) defined in that interface.
*   **`type`**: The `type` keyword is more versatile. It can create aliases for existing types (like `type ID = string`), define unions of types (e.g., `type Status = 'active' | 'inactive'`), or even define object shapes similar to interfaces.
*   **`?` (Optional Properties)**: A question mark after a property name (e.g., `avatar?: string`) indicates that this property is **optional**. An object conforming to this interface might or might not have this property. If it does, it must be of the specified type.
*   **`| null` (Union with `null`)**: When you see `string | null` (e.g., `edited_timestamp?: string | null`), it means the property can either be a `string` OR `null`. The `?` still makes the entire property optional, so it could also be `undefined`.
*   **`any[]`**: This denotes an array where the elements can be of *any* type. It's often used when the exact structure of array elements is not critical, is highly variable, or hasn't been precisely defined yet.
*   **`Record<string, any>`**: This describes an object where all its keys are `string`s, and the value associated with each key can be of `any` type. It's useful for flexible dictionaries or JSON objects where the exact properties aren't known beforehand.
*   **`extends` (Interface Inheritance)**: Similar to classes, interfaces can extend other interfaces. When `interface B extends A`, it means `B` automatically includes all the properties defined in `A`, and can then add its own new properties or override existing ones (though overriding property types is typically discouraged and can lead to errors).
*   **`Omit<Type, Keys>` (Utility Type)**: This is a powerful TypeScript utility type. `Omit<DiscordAuthParams, 'serverId'>` means "create a new type that is exactly like `DiscordAuthParams`, but *without* the `serverId` property." It's used to derive a new type by excluding specific properties from an existing one.
*   **Union Types with `|` (e.g., `DiscordResponse = A | B | C`)**: This means a variable of type `DiscordResponse` can be *any one* of `DiscordSendMessageResponse`, `DiscordGetMessagesResponse`, `DiscordGetServerResponse`, or `DiscordGetUserResponse`. This is incredibly useful for functions that might return different but related types of data depending on the operation.

### **Detailed Line-by-Line Explanation**

Let's go through each interface and type definition:

---

#### **`export interface DiscordMessage`**
Defines the structure of a single message retrieved from Discord.

*   `id: string`: The unique identifier for this message.
*   `content: string`: The actual text content of the message.
*   `channel_id: string`: The unique identifier of the channel where this message was sent.
*   `author: { ... }`: An object containing information about the user who sent the message.
    *   `id: string`: The unique identifier of the message author.
    *   `username: string`: The display name of the message author.
    *   `avatar?: string`: An optional URL pointing to the author's profile picture.
    *   `bot: boolean`: A boolean indicating if the author is a bot (`true`) or a regular user (`false`).
*   `timestamp: string`: A string representing the date and time when the message was created (typically ISO 8601 format).
*   `edited_timestamp?: string | null`: An optional string representing the date and time when the message was last edited. It can also be `null` if the message has never been edited.
*   `embeds: any[]`: An array of any type, representing rich content embeds (like link previews, images, etc.) within the message. The exact structure of embed objects is not defined here.
*   `attachments: any[]`: An array of any type, representing files attached to the message. The exact structure of attachment objects is not defined here.
*   `mentions: any[]`: An array of any type, representing users mentioned in the message. The exact structure of mentioned user objects is not defined here.
*   `mention_roles: string[]`: An array of strings, where each string is the ID of a role mentioned in the message.
*   `mention_everyone: boolean`: A boolean indicating if `@everyone` or `@here` was mentioned in the message.

---

#### **`export interface DiscordAPIError`**
Defines the structure of an error response received from the Discord API.

*   `code: number`: A numeric error code provided by the Discord API, indicating the type of error.
*   `message: string`: A human-readable error message explaining what went wrong.
*   `errors?: Record<string, any>`: An optional object that may contain more specific details about validation errors, where keys are field names and values describe the error for that field.

---

#### **`export interface DiscordGuild`**
Defines the structure of a Discord Guild, which is what Discord calls a "server."

*   `id: string`: The unique identifier for this guild/server.
*   `name: string`: The name of the server.
*   `icon?: string`: An optional URL to the server's icon image.
*   `description?: string`: An optional text description of the server.
*   `owner_id: string`: The unique identifier of the user who owns the server.
*   `roles: any[]`: An array of any type, representing the roles configured in this server. The exact structure of role objects is not defined here.
*   `channels?: any[]`: An optional array of any type, representing the channels within this server. The exact structure of channel objects is not defined here.
*   `member_count?: number`: An optional number indicating how many members are in the server.

---

#### **`export interface DiscordUser`**
Defines the structure of a Discord user account.

*   `id: string`: The unique identifier for this user.
*   `username: string`: The user's display name.
*   `discriminator: string`: The 4-digit Discord tag (e.g., `#1234`) that, combined with the username, forms a unique user identifier (though Discord is moving away from this).
*   `avatar?: string`: An optional URL to the user's profile picture.
*   `bot?: boolean`: An optional boolean indicating if this user account is a bot (`true`) or a regular user (`false`).
*   `system?: boolean`: An optional boolean indicating if this user account is an official Discord system user.
*   `email?: string`: An optional email address of the user (available only with specific authorization scopes).
*   `verified?: boolean`: An optional boolean indicating if the user's email address has been verified.

---

#### **`export interface DiscordAuthParams`**
Defines the fundamental parameters required for authenticating and targeting a specific server in Discord API requests.

*   `botToken: string`: The secret authentication token for your Discord bot. This token is required to authorize API calls.
*   `serverId: string`: The unique identifier of the Discord server (guild) that the bot will be interacting with.

---

#### **`export interface DiscordSendMessageParams extends DiscordAuthParams`**
Defines the parameters needed to send a message to a Discord channel. It inherits authentication details from `DiscordAuthParams`.

*   `extends DiscordAuthParams`: This means `DiscordSendMessageParams` automatically includes `botToken` and `serverId`.
*   `channelId: string`: The unique identifier of the channel where the message should be sent.
*   `content?: string`: An optional string representing the main text content of the message.
*   `embed?: { ... }`: An optional object for sending a rich embed.
    *   `title?: string`: An optional title for the embed.
    *   `description?: string`: An optional main text description for the embed.
    *   `color?: string | number`: An optional color for the embed's sidebar. It can be a hexadecimal string (e.g., `'#FF0000'`) or a numeric representation of a color.

---

#### **`export interface DiscordGetMessagesParams extends DiscordAuthParams`**
Defines the parameters needed to fetch messages from a specific Discord channel. It inherits authentication details.

*   `extends DiscordAuthParams`: This means `DiscordGetMessagesParams` automatically includes `botToken` and `serverId`.
*   `channelId: string`: The unique identifier of the channel from which messages should be fetched.
*   `limit?: number`: An optional number specifying the maximum number of messages to retrieve.

---

#### **`export interface DiscordGetServerParams extends Omit<DiscordAuthParams, 'serverId'>`**
Defines the parameters needed to fetch details about a specific Discord server (guild).

*   `extends Omit<DiscordAuthParams, 'serverId'>`: This means it inherits `botToken` from `DiscordAuthParams`, but explicitly *removes* `serverId` from the inherited properties. This pattern is usually used when the `serverId` needs to be treated differently or specified for a different purpose than the general `serverId` in `DiscordAuthParams`. In this specific case, it makes the explicit `serverId` property below apply uniquely to *which* server is being *fetched*, rather than just the authenticated context.
*   `serverId: string`: The unique identifier of the Discord server (guild) whose details are to be fetched. It's re-added here to ensure it's explicitly required for this specific request.

---

#### **`export interface DiscordGetUserParams extends Omit<DiscordAuthParams, 'serverId'>`**
Defines the parameters needed to fetch details about a specific Discord user.

*   `extends Omit<DiscordAuthParams, 'serverId'>`: This means it inherits `botToken` from `DiscordAuthParams`, but explicitly *removes* `serverId`. This is because fetching a user's details typically only requires the bot's token for authorization, and not a specific server context.
*   `userId: string`: The unique identifier of the Discord user whose details are to be fetched.

---

#### **`interface BaseDiscordResponse`**
Defines the common structure for all API responses from the Discord service. This is a base interface that other response interfaces will extend.

*   `success: boolean`: A boolean indicating whether the API operation was successful (`true`) or failed (`false`).
*   `output: Record<string, any>`: An object containing the primary data returned by the operation. Its exact content will vary depending on the specific API call.
*   `error?: string`: An optional string that will contain a human-readable error message if `success` is `false`.

---

#### **`export interface DiscordSendMessageResponse extends BaseDiscordResponse`**
Defines the expected response structure after attempting to send a Discord message.

*   `extends BaseDiscordResponse`: It inherits `success`, `output`, and `error?` from `BaseDiscordResponse`.
*   `output: { ... }`: It specifically defines the shape of the `output` property for a message sending response.
    *   `message: string`: A human-readable status message (e.g., "Message sent successfully").
    *   `data?: DiscordMessage`: An optional `DiscordMessage` object, which will be present if the message was successfully sent and provides details of the new message.

---

#### **`export interface DiscordGetMessagesResponse extends BaseDiscordResponse`**
Defines the expected response structure after attempting to fetch Discord messages.

*   `extends BaseDiscordResponse`: It inherits `success`, `output`, and `error?` from `BaseDiscordResponse`.
*   `output: { ... }`: It specifically defines the shape of the `output` property for a message fetching response.
    *   `message: string`: A human-readable status message (e.g., "Messages retrieved").
    *   `data?: { ... }`: An optional object containing the fetched message data.
        *   `messages: DiscordMessage[]`: An array of `DiscordMessage` objects, representing the fetched messages.
        *   `channel_id: string`: The unique identifier of the channel from which these messages were retrieved.

---

#### **`export interface DiscordGetServerResponse extends BaseDiscordResponse`**
Defines the expected response structure after attempting to fetch Discord server (guild) details.

*   `extends BaseDiscordResponse`: It inherits `success`, `output`, and `error?` from `BaseDiscordResponse`.
*   `output: { ... }`: It specifically defines the shape of the `output` property for a server fetching response.
    *   `message: string`: A human-readable status message (e.g., "Server details retrieved").
    *   `data?: DiscordGuild`: An optional `DiscordGuild` object, containing the detailed information about the fetched server.

---

#### **`export interface DiscordGetUserResponse extends BaseDiscordResponse`**
Defines the expected response structure after attempting to fetch Discord user details.

*   `extends BaseDiscordResponse`: It inherits `success`, `output`, and `error?` from `BaseDiscordResponse`.
*   `output: { ... }`: It specifically defines the shape of the `output` property for a user fetching response.
    *   `message: string`: A human-readable status message (e.g., "User details retrieved").
    *   `data?: DiscordUser`: An optional `DiscordUser` object, containing the detailed information about the fetched user.

---

#### **`export type DiscordResponse`**
This is a **union type** that combines all possible Discord API response types defined in this file.

*   `|`: The pipe symbol creates a union. This means a variable of type `DiscordResponse` can be *any one* of the types listed:
    *   `DiscordSendMessageResponse`
    *   `DiscordGetMessagesResponse`
    *   `DiscordGetServerResponse`
    *   `DiscordGetUserResponse`
This is incredibly useful for writing functions that handle different API calls but return a standardized, yet specific, response type, allowing you to use type narrowing (e.g., `if ('messages' in response.output.data)`) to determine which specific response type you're dealing with at runtime.
