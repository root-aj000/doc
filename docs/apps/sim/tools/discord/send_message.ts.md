This TypeScript code defines a "tool" designed for an AI or an automation system. This specific tool, named `discordSendMessageTool`, provides a standardized way to send messages to a Discord channel by interacting with the Discord API.

It acts as a configuration blueprint, detailing:
1.  **What inputs it needs** (e.g., bot token, channel ID, message content).
2.  **How to construct an HTTP request** to the Discord API using those inputs.
3.  **How to process the response** from Discord.
4.  **What structured output** the tool will provide back to the system that invoked it.

In essence, it wraps the complexity of making a Discord API call into a simple, reusable interface for a larger system.

### Simplified Logic Explanation

Imagine you have an intelligent assistant (like an LLM or an automation engine) that can perform various actions. This `discordSendMessageTool` teaches that assistant *how* to send a message on Discord.

Instead of the assistant needing to know the exact Discord API endpoint, how to format headers, or what the response will look like, it just uses this "tool definition."

*   **Inputs (`params`):** The tool lists what information it needs, like `botToken`, `channelId`, `content`, and `serverId`. It also specifies if these are required and who typically provides them (a human user, or the assistant itself).
*   **Action (`request`):** This section tells the tool how to build the actual web request to Discord. It's smart enough to take the `params` you give it and dynamically create the correct URL, add the authentication token to the headers, and put the message content into the request body.
*   **Result Interpretation (`transformResponse`):** Once Discord sends back a response, this part of the tool takes that raw data and processes it. It extracts the meaningful information (like the sent message's ID and content) and puts it into a standard, easy-to-understand format.
*   **Outputs (`outputs`):** Finally, it describes what kind of structured data the assistant can expect to receive after the message is sent, making it easy for the assistant to use that information (e.g., confirm the message was sent).

The most "complex" logic involves the `request` section, where functions are used to dynamically generate the URL, headers, and body based on the provided input parameters. This makes the tool highly flexible. The `transformResponse` then cleanly processes the API's JSON response into a consistent output format for the calling system.

### Line-by-Line Explanation

```typescript
import type {
  DiscordMessage,
  DiscordSendMessageParams,
  DiscordSendMessageResponse,
} from '@/tools/discord/types'
```
*   This line imports TypeScript type definitions. These types are crucial for ensuring the code is robust and easy to understand by clearly defining the shape of data.
    *   `DiscordMessage`: Represents the structure of a message object as returned by the Discord API.
    *   `DiscordSendMessageParams`: Defines the structure of the input parameters that *this tool* expects when someone wants to send a Discord message.
    *   `DiscordSendMessageResponse`: Defines the structure of the successful output that *this tool* will return after it has sent a message.
*   The `@/tools/discord/types` path suggests these types are defined in a separate file within the project's `tools/discord` directory.

```typescript
import type { ToolConfig } from '@/tools/types'
```
*   This line imports the generic `ToolConfig` type. This type defines the standard structure for *any* tool within this framework. It acts as a template for how tools should be configured.
*   It's parameterized, meaning it takes two other types: one for the tool's input parameters and one for its output response.

```typescript
export const discordSendMessageTool: ToolConfig<
  DiscordSendMessageParams,
  DiscordSendMessageResponse
> = {
```
*   `export const discordSendMessageTool`: Declares a constant variable named `discordSendMessageTool` and makes it available for use in other files (`export`).
*   `: ToolConfig<DiscordSendMessageParams, DiscordSendMessageResponse>`: This is a type annotation. It states that `discordSendMessageTool` *must* conform to the `ToolConfig` interface, specifically configured to accept `DiscordSendMessageParams` as its inputs and produce `DiscordSendMessageResponse` as its output. This provides strong type-checking and clarity.
*   `= {`: Starts the definition of the `discordSendMessageTool` object, which contains all the configuration for this specific tool.

```typescript
  id: 'discord_send_message',
```
*   `id`: A unique identifier for this tool, typically used internally by the system to reference it.

```typescript
  name: 'Discord Send Message',
```
*   `name`: A human-readable name for the tool, often used in user interfaces or logs.

```typescript
  description: 'Send a message to a Discord channel',
```
*   `description`: A brief explanation of what the tool does, helpful for documentation or for an AI to understand its purpose.

```typescript
  version: '1.0.0',
```
*   `version`: The version number of this tool's configuration, useful for tracking changes and compatibility.

```typescript
  params: {
```
*   `params`: This object defines all the input parameters that the tool requires to function. Each property within `params` is a specific input.

```typescript
    botToken: {
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
      visibility: 'user-only',
      description: 'The bot token for authentication',
    },
```
*   `botToken`:
    *   `type: 'string'`: The parameter is expected to be a string.
    *   `required: true`: This parameter *must* be provided for the tool to work.
    *   `visibility: 'user-only'`: Indicates that this parameter should typically be provided by a human user (e.g., an administrator configuring the system), not generated by an AI. This often applies to sensitive or foundational configuration.
    *   `description: 'The bot token for authentication'`: Explains the purpose of the parameter.

```typescript
    channelId: {
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
      visibility: 'user-only',
      description: 'The Discord channel ID to send the message to',
    },
```
*   `channelId`: Similar to `botToken`, this is a required string, typically provided by the user, specifying the Discord channel where the message should be sent.

```typescript
    content: {
      type: 'string',
      required: false,
      visibility: 'user-or-llm',
      description: 'The text content of the message',
    },
```
*   `content`:
    *   `type: 'string'`: Expected to be a string.
    *   `required: false`: This parameter is *optional*. If not provided, the tool will handle it (as seen later in the `body` function).
    *   `visibility: 'user-or-llm'`: This means either a human user *or* an AI/LLM can provide the message content. This makes the tool flexible for AI-driven message generation.
    *   `description: 'The text content of the message'`: Explains its purpose.

```typescript
    serverId: {
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
      visibility: 'user-only',
      description: 'The Discord server ID (guild ID)',
    },
  },
```
*   `serverId`: A required string, typically user-provided, representing the Discord server (guild) ID. While not directly used in the API call's URL/body for *sending a message* (only `channelId` is needed for that endpoint), it's likely included here for broader context, validation, or future use within the tool framework.

```typescript
  request: {
```
*   `request`: This object defines how to construct the actual HTTP request that will be sent to the external Discord API.

```typescript
    url: (params: DiscordSendMessageParams) =>
      `https://discord.com/api/v10/channels/${params.channelId}/messages`,
```
*   `url`: This is a function that takes the `params` (the inputs to the tool) and returns the full URL for the API call.
    *   `(params: DiscordSendMessageParams) => ...`: It's an arrow function that receives the `params` object.
    *   `` `https://discord.com/api/v10/channels/${params.channelId}/messages` ``: This is a template literal that dynamically constructs the Discord API endpoint. It inserts the `channelId` from the `params` into the URL to target the correct channel for message sending. `v10` refers to Discord API version 10.

```typescript
    method: 'POST',
```
*   `method`: Specifies the HTTP method to use for the request. `POST` is used for sending new data (a new message in this case).

```typescript
    headers: (params: DiscordSendMessageParams) => {
      const headers: Record<string, string> = {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      }
```
*   `headers`: This is also a function that takes the `params` and returns an object of HTTP headers.
    *   `const headers: Record<string, string> = { ... }`: Initializes an object to store headers. `Record<string, string>` is a TypeScript type indicating an object where keys and values are both strings.
    *   `'Content-Type': 'application/json'`: This standard header tells the Discord API that the request body will be in JSON format.

```typescript
      if (params.botToken) {
        headers.Authorization = `Bot ${params.botToken}`
      }
```
*   `if (params.botToken)`: Checks if a `botToken` was provided in the tool's parameters.
*   `headers.Authorization = `Bot ${params.botToken}``: If a `botToken` exists, it adds an `Authorization` header. Discord's API requires bot tokens to be prefixed with `Bot ` for authentication.

```typescript
      return headers
    },
```
*   `return headers`: Returns the constructed headers object.

```typescript
    body: (params: DiscordSendMessageParams) => {
      const body: Record<string, any> = {}
```
*   `body`: This is a function that takes the `params` and returns the HTTP request body (the data payload) as a JavaScript object, which will then be converted to JSON.
    *   `const body: Record<string, any> = {}`: Initializes an empty object to build the request body. `Record<string, any>` indicates keys are strings and values can be of any type.

```typescript
      if (params.content) {
        body.content = params.content
      }
```
*   `if (params.content)`: Checks if the `content` parameter was provided by the caller.
*   `body.content = params.content`: If `content` exists, it's added to the `body` object.

```typescript
      if (!body.content) {
        body.content = 'Message sent from Sim'
      }
```
*   `if (!body.content)`: This is a crucial fallback. If `params.content` was *not* provided (or was an empty string), `body.content` would still be undefined or empty. This condition ensures that a default message `'Message sent from Sim'` is used in such cases, preventing an empty message from being sent or the API from potentially rejecting the request.

```typescript
      return body
    },
  },
```
*   `return body`: Returns the constructed request body object.

```typescript
  transformResponse: async (response) => {
```
*   `transformResponse`: This is an `async` function responsible for taking the raw HTTP `response` received from the Discord API and transforming it into a standardized output format for the tool.

```typescript
    const data = (await response.json()) as DiscordMessage
```
*   `await response.json()`: Asynchronously parses the body of the HTTP response as JSON.
*   `as DiscordMessage`: This is a TypeScript type assertion, telling the compiler to treat the parsed JSON data as a `DiscordMessage` type. This helps ensure type safety when accessing properties of `data` later.

```typescript
    return {
      success: true,
      output: {
        message: 'Discord message sent successfully',
        data,
      },
    }
  },
```
*   `return { success: true, ... }`: Returns an object indicating the success status and the actual output. This is the `DiscordSendMessageResponse` type defined at the top.
*   `success: true`: Indicates that the tool executed successfully.
*   `output`: Contains the specific results of the tool's operation.
    *   `message: 'Discord message sent successfully'`: A human-readable success message.
    *   `data`: The parsed `DiscordMessage` object received directly from the Discord API, containing details of the sent message.

```typescript
  outputs: {
```
*   `outputs`: This object formally describes the structure of the data that the tool will return when it successfully completes (`DiscordSendMessageResponse`). This is crucial for systems (like LLMs or automation engines) to understand what information they can expect and how to use it.

```typescript
    message: { type: 'string', description: 'Success or error message' },
```
*   `message`: Describes the `message` property within the tool's output.
    *   `type: 'string'`: It will be a string.
    *   `description: 'Success or error message'`: Explains its purpose.

```typescript
    data: {
      type: 'object',
      description: 'Discord message data',
      properties: {
        id: { type: 'string', description: 'Message ID' },
        content: { type: 'string', description: 'Message content' },
        channel_id: { type: 'string', description: 'Channel ID where message was sent' },
        author: {
          type: 'object',
          description: 'Message author information',
          properties: {
            id: { type: 'string', description: 'Author user ID' },
            username: { type: 'string', description: 'Author username' },
            avatar: { type: 'string', description: 'Author avatar hash' },
            bot: { type: 'boolean', description: 'Whether author is a bot' },
          },
        },
        timestamp: { type: 'string', description: 'Message timestamp' },
        edited_timestamp: { type: 'string', description: 'Message edited timestamp' },
        embeds: { type: 'array', description: 'Message embeds' },
        attachments: { type: 'array', description: 'Message attachments' },
        mentions: { type: 'array', description: 'User mentions in message' },
        mention_roles: { type: 'array', description: 'Role mentions in message' },
        mention_everyone: { type: 'boolean', description: 'Whether message mentions everyone' },
      },
    },
  },
}
```
*   `data`: Describes the `data` property within the tool's output.
    *   `type: 'object'`: It will be an object.
    *   `description: 'Discord message data'`: Explains its purpose.
    *   `properties`: This nested object describes each individual property found within the `data` object (which directly corresponds to the `DiscordMessage` type from the API). Each property has its `type` (e.g., `'string'`, `'boolean'`, `'array'`, `'object'`) and a `description`. This detailed schema allows consumers of the tool's output to understand the exact shape and meaning of the data they receive. For example:
        *   `id`, `content`, `channel_id`: Basic message identifiers and content.
        *   `author`: A nested object describing the sender of the message (the bot itself in this case).
        *   `timestamp`, `edited_timestamp`: When the message was sent/edited.
        *   `embeds`, `attachments`, `mentions`, `mention_roles`: Arrays for various rich content or mentions within the message.
        *   `mention_everyone`: A boolean indicating if `@everyone` was mentioned.
