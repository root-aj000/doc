This TypeScript file defines a "tool" configuration for interacting with the Discord API to retrieve information about a specific Discord server (also known as a "guild"). It's structured in a way that allows an external system (perhaps an automation platform or a UI builder) to understand what this tool does, what inputs it needs, how it makes its request, and what kind of output it produces.

Let's break it down.

---

### **Purpose of this File**

The primary purpose of this file is to **declare a standardized configuration for a Discord API interaction**. Specifically, it defines a callable "tool" named `discordGetServerTool` that can:

1.  **Accept specific parameters:** A bot token for authentication and a server ID.
2.  **Construct an HTTP request:** Using the provided parameters to form the correct URL and authorization headers for Discord's API.
3.  **Process the API's raw response:** Parse the JSON data returned by Discord and structure it into a usable format.
4.  **Describe its output:** Clearly define the format and content of the information it provides back to the caller.

This declarative approach makes the tool reusable, self-documenting, and easy for other systems to integrate and automate.

---

### **Simplified Complex Logic**

The core idea here isn't about complex algorithms, but about a **declarative pattern** for defining API interactions. Instead of directly writing code that *imperatively* fetches data from Discord (e.g., `fetch(...)`), this file *declares* the characteristics of a tool that can do it.

Think of it like providing a detailed instruction manual to a robot:

*   **"Here's what I need from you (params):"** Define the exact inputs.
*   **"Here's how you talk to the Discord server (request):"** Specify the URL, method, and authentication.
*   **"Here's how you understand what Discord tells you (transformResponse):"** Explain how to interpret the raw data.
*   **"Here's what you'll tell me back (outputs):"** Describe the final result format.

This pattern makes the process robust, easy to understand, and less prone to errors because all parts of the interaction are clearly specified and typed.

### **Explanation of Each Line of Code**

```typescript
import type {
  DiscordGetServerParams,
  DiscordGetServerResponse,
  DiscordGuild,
} from '@/tools/discord/types'
import type { ToolConfig } from '@/tools/types'
```

*   **`import type { ... } from '...'`**: These lines import TypeScript *type definitions* from other files. The `type` keyword ensures that only type information is imported, not actual JavaScript code, which helps keep the compiled bundle size small.
    *   **`DiscordGetServerParams`**: This type defines the expected structure of the input parameters that the `discordGetServerTool` will accept (e.g., `botToken` and `serverId`).
    *   **`DiscordGetServerResponse`**: This type defines the expected structure of the final output that the `discordGetServerTool` will produce after processing the Discord API response.
    *   **`DiscordGuild`**: This type represents the raw data structure that Discord's API returns when you request information about a guild (server). It's the "shape" of the JSON object directly from Discord.
    *   **`ToolConfig`**: This is a generic type that defines the overall structure for any tool configuration. It likely expects two generic arguments: the type of its input parameters and the type of its output response.

---

```typescript
export const discordGetServerTool: ToolConfig<DiscordGetServerParams, DiscordGetServerResponse> = {
```

*   **`export const discordGetServerTool`**: This declares a constant variable named `discordGetServerTool` and makes it available for other files to import and use (`export`).
*   **`: ToolConfig<DiscordGetServerParams, DiscordGetServerResponse>`**: This is a TypeScript type annotation. It tells TypeScript that `discordGetServerTool` must conform to the `ToolConfig` interface, specifically configured to take `DiscordGetServerParams` as input and produce `DiscordGetServerResponse` as output. This provides strong type checking for the entire configuration object.
*   **`= { ... }`**: This assigns an object literal to `discordGetServerTool`, defining its properties.

---

```typescript
  id: 'discord_get_server',
  name: 'Discord Get Server',
  description: 'Retrieve information about a Discord server (guild)',
  version: '1.0.0',
```

These are basic metadata fields for the tool:
*   **`id: 'discord_get_server'`**: A unique, programmatic identifier for this tool.
*   **`name: 'Discord Get Server'`**: A human-readable name, useful for UIs or logs.
*   **`description: 'Retrieve information about a Discord server (guild)'`**: A short explanation of what the tool does.
*   **`version: '1.0.0'`**: A version number for tracking changes to this tool definition.

```typescript
  params: {
    botToken: {
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
      visibility: 'user-only',
      description: 'The bot token for authentication',
    },
    serverId: {
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
      visibility: 'user-only',
      description: 'The Discord server ID (guild ID)',
    },
  },
```

This `params` object defines the input arguments the tool expects. Each property describes a single input parameter:
*   **`botToken`**:
    *   **`type: 'string'`**: Specifies that `botToken` must be a string.
    *   **`required: true`**: Indicates that this parameter is mandatory for the tool to function.
    *   **`visibility: 'user-only'`**: Suggests that this token should be handled securely and perhaps only shown to the user who owns it (e.g., not logged in plain text, not exposed in shared contexts).
    *   **`description: 'The bot token for authentication'`**: Explains the purpose of this parameter.
*   **`serverId`**:
    *   **`type: 'string'`**: Specifies that `serverId` must be a string.
    *   **`required: true`**: Indicates that this parameter is mandatory.
    *   **`visibility: 'user-only'`**: Similar to `botToken`, this ID might be sensitive or specific to a user's context.
    *   **`description: 'The Discord server ID (guild ID)'`**: Explains its purpose.

---

```typescript
  request: {
    url: (params: DiscordGetServerParams) =>
      `https://discord.com/api/v10/guilds/${params.serverId}`,
    method: 'GET',
    headers: (params: DiscordGetServerParams) => {
      const headers: Record<string, string> = {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      }

      if (params.botToken) {
        headers.Authorization = `Bot ${params.botToken}`
      }

      return headers
    },
  },
```

This `request` object specifies how to construct the actual HTTP request to the Discord API:
*   **`url: (params: DiscordGetServerParams) => ...`**: This is a function that takes the tool's input `params` and returns the complete URL for the API call.
    *   `` `https://discord.com/api/v10/guilds/${params.serverId}` ``: This is a template literal. It dynamically inserts the `serverId` from the `params` object into the Discord API endpoint for fetching guild (server) details using API version `v10`.
*   **`method: 'GET'`**: Specifies that this will be an HTTP GET request, typically used for retrieving data.
*   **`headers: (params: DiscordGetServerParams) => { ... }`**: This is a function that takes the tool's input `params` and returns an object containing HTTP headers for the request.
    *   **`const headers: Record<string, string> = { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', }`**: Initializes a `headers` object with a standard `Content-Type` header, indicating that the request (if it had a body) would be JSON.
    *   **`if (params.botToken) { ... }`**: This checks if a `botToken` was provided in the input parameters.
    *   **`headers.Authorization = `Bot ${params.botToken}``**: If a `botToken` exists, it adds an `Authorization` header. Discord's API requires bot tokens to be prefixed with `Bot ` (e.g., `Authorization: Bot YOUR_BOT_TOKEN`).
    *   **`return headers`**: Returns the constructed headers object.

```typescript
  transformResponse: async (response: Response) => {
    const responseData = await response.json()

    return {
      success: true,
      output: {
        message: 'Successfully retrieved server information',
        data: responseData as DiscordGuild,
      },
    }
  },
```

This `transformResponse` function is an asynchronous function responsible for taking the raw HTTP `Response` object received from the Discord API and turning it into the tool's structured output:
*   **`async (response: Response) => { ... }`**: Defines an asynchronous function that accepts a standard `Response` object (as returned by `fetch`).
*   **`const responseData = await response.json()`**: The `response.json()` method asynchronously parses the body of the HTTP response stream as JSON. `await` pauses execution until the parsing is complete, and `responseData` will hold the parsed JavaScript object.
*   **`return { ... }`**: This object is the final output of the tool, conforming to the `DiscordGetServerResponse` type.
    *   **`success: true`**: A boolean flag indicating that the operation was successful. (In a more robust implementation, you might check `response.ok` or `response.status` for error handling).
    *   **`output: { ... }`**: An object containing the actual data and a message.
        *   **`message: 'Successfully retrieved server information'`**: A human-friendly status message.
        *   **`data: responseData as DiscordGuild`**: The parsed JSON data from the Discord API is assigned to `data`. The `as DiscordGuild` is a TypeScript "type assertion," telling the compiler that `responseData` (which is `any` after `response.json()`) should be treated as conforming to the `DiscordGuild` type. This reintroduces type safety for the API response.

```typescript
  outputs: {
    message: { type: 'string', description: 'Success or error message' },
    data: {
      type: 'object',
      description: 'Discord server (guild) information',
      properties: {
        id: { type: 'string', description: 'Server ID' },
        name: { type: 'string', description: 'Server name' },
        icon: { type: 'string', description: 'Server icon hash' },
        description: { type: 'string', description: 'Server description' },
        owner_id: { type: 'string', description: 'Server owner user ID' },
        roles: { type: 'array', description: 'Server roles' },
        channels: { type: 'array', description: 'Server channels' },
        member_count: { type: 'number', description: 'Number of members in server' },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

This `outputs` object provides a detailed schema of the data that the `transformResponse` function will return. This is useful for documentation, validation, or automatically generating UI elements:
*   **`message: { ... }`**: Describes the `message` field in the output.
    *   **`type: 'string'`**: It will be a string.
    *   **`description: 'Success or error message'`**: Explains its content.
*   **`data: { ... }`**: Describes the `data` field in the output, which holds the primary server information.
    *   **`type: 'object'`**: It will be a JavaScript object.
    *   **`description: 'Discord server (guild) information'`**: Explains what this object represents.
    *   **`properties: { ... }`**: This nested object defines the individual fields (properties) that will be found within the `data` object, along with their types and descriptions. These correspond to common fields found in a `DiscordGuild` object.
        *   **`id: { type: 'string', description: 'Server ID' }`**: The unique ID of the server.
        *   **`name: { type: 'string', description: 'Server name' }`**: The human-readable name of the server.
        *   **`icon: { type: 'string', description: 'Server icon hash' }`**: A hash that can be used to construct the URL for the server's icon.
        *   **`description: { type: 'string', description: 'Server description' }`**: The server's public description.
        *   **`owner_id: { type: 'string', description: 'Server owner user ID' }`**: The ID of the user who owns the server.
        *   **`roles: { type: 'array', description: 'Server roles' }`**: An array containing information about the server's roles.
        *   **`channels: { type: 'array', description: 'Server channels' }`**: An array containing information about the server's channels.
        *   **`member_count: { type: 'number', description: 'Number of members in server' }`**: The total number of members in the server.

This comprehensive schema ensures that any system consuming this tool's output knows exactly what data to expect and how to interpret it.
