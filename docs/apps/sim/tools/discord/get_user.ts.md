This TypeScript file defines a "tool" configuration for interacting with the Discord API. Specifically, it describes how to retrieve information about a Discord user. Think of it as a blueprint or a recipe for a specific API call, rather than the code that actually makes the call.

It's designed to be used within a larger system that can interpret these `ToolConfig` objects and execute the described API interactions. This pattern allows for standardized, declarative definitions of various API integrations.

### Purpose of This File

The primary purpose of `discordGetUserTool.ts` is to:

1.  **Define a standard interface for fetching Discord user data:** It specifies what parameters are needed (`userId`, `botToken`) and what information will be returned (`id`, `username`, `email`, etc.).
2.  **Encapsulate Discord API details:** It contains the specific URL, HTTP method, and header construction (including authentication) required to call the Discord "Get User" endpoint.
3.  **Standardize response handling:** It includes logic to take the raw JSON response from Discord and transform it into a consistent, application-specific output format.
4.  **Enable declarative tooling:** By defining this as a `ToolConfig` object, a generic "tool runner" in the application can discover, validate, and execute this Discord integration without needing custom code for each API call.

In essence, this file acts as a **configuration object** that describes *how* to call the Discord API to get user information, *what* inputs it needs, and *what* outputs it produces.

### Detailed, Line-by-Line Explanation

Let's break down the code step by step:

#### Imports

```typescript
import type {
  DiscordGetUserParams,
  DiscordGetUserResponse,
  DiscordUser,
} from '@/tools/discord/types'
import type { ToolConfig } from '@/tools/types'
```

*   **`import type { ... } from '@/tools/discord/types'`**: This line imports several TypeScript *type definitions* from a local path (`@/tools/discord/types`). The `type` keyword indicates that these imports are only for type checking during development and compilation; they won't generate any JavaScript code at runtime.
    *   **`DiscordGetUserParams`**: This type defines the structure of the input parameters required to use this tool (e.g., `botToken`, `userId`).
    *   **`DiscordGetUserResponse`**: This type defines the expected structure of the *final, transformed output* that this tool will produce after successfully making the API call and processing the response.
    *   **`DiscordUser`**: This type represents the raw structure of a user object as it's returned directly by the Discord API.
*   **`import type { ToolConfig } from '@/tools/types'`**: This imports a generic type definition called `ToolConfig` from another local path. This `ToolConfig` type is a blueprint for defining any API integration or "tool" in the system, ensuring they all follow a consistent structure.

#### Tool Configuration Definition

```typescript
export const discordGetUserTool: ToolConfig<DiscordGetUserParams, DiscordGetUserResponse> = {
  // ... tool configuration properties ...
}
```

*   **`export const discordGetUserTool`**: This declares and exports a constant variable named `discordGetUserTool`. `export` makes this variable available for other files to import and use.
*   **`: ToolConfig<DiscordGetUserParams, DiscordGetUserResponse>`**: This is a TypeScript type annotation. It states that `discordGetUserTool` must conform to the `ToolConfig` type.
    *   `ToolConfig` is a generic type, and here it's instantiated with two type arguments:
        *   `DiscordGetUserParams`: Specifies the type of the input parameters this particular tool expects.
        *   `DiscordGetUserResponse`: Specifies the type of the output this tool will produce.
*   **`= { ... }`**: This assigns an object literal to `discordGetUserTool`, containing all the configuration details for this Discord "Get User" tool.

#### Basic Tool Metadata

```typescript
  id: 'discord_get_user',
  name: 'Discord Get User',
  description: 'Retrieve information about a Discord user',
  version: '1.0.0',
```

These properties provide basic identifying information about the tool:

*   **`id: 'discord_get_user'`**: A unique identifier for this specific tool. Useful for programmatic lookups.
*   **`name: 'Discord Get User'`**: A human-readable name for the tool, often used in UIs or logs.
*   **`description: 'Retrieve information about a Discord user'`**: A brief explanation of what the tool does.
*   **`version: '1.0.0'`**: The version of this tool definition.

#### Input Parameters Definition (`params`)

```typescript
  params: {
    botToken: {
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
      visibility: 'user-only',
      description: 'Discord bot token for authentication',
    },
    userId: {
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
      visibility: 'user-only',
      description: 'The Discord user ID',
    },
  },
```

This `params` object defines the specific input arguments that this tool requires to function. Each property within `params` (like `botToken` and `userId`) describes one input argument:

*   **`botToken`**:
    *   **`type: 'string'`**: Specifies that the `botToken` must be a string.
    *   **`required: true`**: Indicates that this parameter is mandatory; the tool cannot be executed without it.
    *   **`visibility: 'user-only'`**: This is a custom property (not standard TypeScript or JSON Schema) likely used by the consuming system. It suggests that this parameter might be sensitive (like an API key) and should perhaps not be logged, displayed widely, or shared broadly.
    *   **`description: 'Discord bot token for authentication'`**: Explains the purpose of the token.
*   **`userId`**:
    *   **`type: 'string'`**: Specifies that the `userId` must be a string.
    *   **`required: true`**: Indicates this parameter is also mandatory.
    *   **`visibility: 'user-only'`**: Similar to `botToken`, suggesting it might be sensitive or specific to the user making the request.
    *   **`description: 'The Discord user ID'`**: Explains that this is the unique identifier for the Discord user whose information is being sought.

#### HTTP Request Configuration (`request`)

```typescript
  request: {
    url: (params: DiscordGetUserParams) => `https://discord.com/api/v10/users/${params.userId}`,
    method: 'GET',
    headers: (params: DiscordGetUserParams) => {
      const headers: Record<string, string> = {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      }

      if (params.botToken) {
        headers.Authorization = `Bot ${params.botToken}`
      }

      return headers
    },
  },
```

This `request` object specifies *how* to make the HTTP call to the Discord API:

*   **`url: (params: DiscordGetUserParams) => `https://discord.com/api/v10/users/${params.userId}``**:
    *   This is a **function** that takes the input `params` (defined above) and returns the full URL for the API request.
    *   This allows the URL to be dynamic, incorporating values from the input parameters. Here, it constructs the Discord API endpoint for getting user details by inserting the `userId` into the URL path. `v10` refers to Discord API version 10.
*   **`method: 'GET'`**: Specifies that this will be an HTTP GET request, which is standard for retrieving data.
*   **`headers: (params: DiscordGetUserParams) => { ... }`**:
    *   Similar to `url`, this is a **function** that takes the input `params` and returns an object representing the HTTP headers for the request. This allows headers to be dynamically generated.
    *   **`const headers: Record<string, string> = { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', }`**: Initializes an object to hold the headers. It sets the `Content-Type` header, though for a GET request with no body, this is often not strictly necessary but harmless.
    *   **`if (params.botToken) { headers.Authorization = `Bot ${params.botToken}` }`**: This is crucial for authentication. If a `botToken` is provided in the input parameters, it constructs the `Authorization` header in the format required by Discord for bot authentication: `Bot <your-token>`.
    *   **`return headers`**: Returns the complete set of headers to be used in the HTTP request.

#### Response Transformation (`transformResponse`)

```typescript
  transformResponse: async (response) => {
    const data: DiscordUser = await response.json()

    return {
      success: true,
      output: {
        message: `Retrieved information for Discord user: ${data.username}`,
        data,
      },
    }
  },
```

This `transformResponse` function processes the raw HTTP response received from the Discord API and converts it into the standardized `DiscordGetUserResponse` format defined for this tool:

*   **`async (response) => { ... }`**: This is an asynchronous function that takes the raw `Response` object (from a `fetch` API call or similar) as input. It's `async` because `response.json()` is an asynchronous operation.
*   **`const data: DiscordUser = await response.json()`**: This line asynchronously reads the body of the HTTP response and parses it as JSON. The result is explicitly typed as `DiscordUser`, matching the raw data structure expected from Discord.
*   **`return { ... }`**: This object is the *transformed output* of the tool.
    *   **`success: true`**: Indicates that the operation was successful. A more robust implementation might include error handling here for `success: false`.
    *   **`output: { ... }`**: This object contains the actual data and a user-friendly message.
        *   **`message: `Retrieved information for Discord user: ${data.username}``**: A dynamic, human-readable message confirming the operation and including the username from the retrieved `DiscordUser` data.
        *   **`data`**: This property holds the raw `DiscordUser` object (`data`) received from Discord, making it accessible in the tool's output.

#### Output Definition (`outputs`)

```typescript
  outputs: {
    message: { type: 'string', description: 'Success or error message' },
    data: {
      type: 'object',
      description: 'Discord user information',
      properties: {
        id: { type: 'string', description: 'User ID' },
        username: { type: 'string', description: 'Username' },
        discriminator: { type: 'string', description: 'User discriminator (4-digit number)' },
        avatar: { type: 'string', description: 'User avatar hash' },
        bot: { type: 'boolean', description: 'Whether user is a bot' },
        system: { type: 'boolean', description: 'Whether user is a system user' },
        email: { type: 'string', description: 'User email (if available)' },
        verified: { type: 'boolean', description: 'Whether user email is verified' },
      },
    },
  },
```

This `outputs` object *declares* the expected structure of the `DiscordGetUserResponse` (the transformed output). This is highly valuable for documentation, validating the `transformResponse` function, and allowing other parts of the system (like UIs or automated workflows) to understand what data to expect:

*   **`message`**:
    *   **`type: 'string'`**: Declares that the `message` property in the output will be a string.
    *   **`description: 'Success or error message'`**: Explains its purpose.
*   **`data`**:
    *   **`type: 'object'`**: Declares that the `data` property in the output will be an object.
    *   **`description: 'Discord user information'`**: Explains its purpose.
    *   **`properties`**: This nested object lists and describes the individual fields expected within the `data` object (which corresponds to the `DiscordUser` type). Each property specifies its `type` and a `description`.
        *   `id`: User ID (string).
        *   `username`: Username (string).
        *   `discriminator`: The 4-digit Discord tag (string).
        *   `avatar`: Hash for the user's avatar image (string).
        *   `bot`: Boolean indicating if the user is a bot.
        *   `system`: Boolean indicating if the user is a system user.
        *   `email`: User's email (string, if available and permissions allow).
        *   `verified`: Boolean indicating if the user's email is verified.

### Simplified Complex Logic

1.  **Dynamic URLs and Headers:** Instead of hardcoding the API endpoint and authentication, the `url` and `headers` are defined as *functions*. This allows them to be built dynamically using the `params` provided to the tool. This is a powerful pattern for creating reusable API integrations where parts of the request depend on user-supplied data.

2.  **`transformResponse` Function:** This part is key. The raw data returned by any API might not be exactly what your application needs. `transformResponse` acts as an adapter, taking the raw Discord API response (`DiscordUser`) and wrapping it into a standardized output format (`DiscordGetUserResponse`) that includes a `success` flag and a custom `message`. This makes the output of all tools consistent, regardless of the underlying API.

3.  **`ToolConfig` Pattern:** The entire file is an instance of a `ToolConfig`. This is a system-level abstraction. It allows an application to define many different "tools" (API calls, internal functions, etc.) using a consistent structure. This "declarative" approach means the system can read this configuration and understand what the tool does, what inputs it needs, and what outputs it produces, without needing to know the specific implementation details of Discord's API. It simplifies the overall architecture by standardizing how integrations are described and executed.

In essence, this file defines a highly organized, type-safe, and reusable way to interact with the Discord API's "Get User" endpoint within a larger application framework.
