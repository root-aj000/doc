This TypeScript file acts as a **schema definition** for interacting with Google Sheets through a programmatic "tool." It defines the precise structure of data that goes into (parameters) and comes out of (responses) various operations like reading, writing, updating, and appending data in a Google Sheet.

Think of it as the blueprints for communication with a specialized Google Sheets connector.

---

### **1. Purpose of This File**

The primary purpose of this file is to establish clear and consistent data structures (using TypeScript interfaces and types) for:

1.  **Defining parameters** required to perform operations on a Google Sheet (e.g., which spreadsheet, what range, what values to write).
2.  **Structuring the responses** received after performing those operations (e.g., what data was read, how many cells were updated, metadata about the sheet).
3.  **Ensuring type safety** and providing excellent developer experience by making explicit what data is expected at each stage of a Google Sheets interaction.

In essence, it's the **contract** that dictates how a system communicates with Google Sheets functionality.

---

### **2. Simplifying Complex Logic**

At its core, this file breaks down the interaction with Google Sheets into two main categories:

*   **Inputs (Parameters):** Defined by `GoogleSheetsToolParams`. This interface specifies all the configurable options you can provide when asking the "tool" to do something with a Google Sheet.
*   **Outputs (Responses):** There are several response interfaces (`GoogleSheetsReadResponse`, `GoogleSheetsWriteResponse`, etc.), each tailored to a specific type of operation.
    *   All these responses **extend `ToolResponse`** (an external base type), meaning they share common properties like a status or error message from the overall "tool" execution.
    *   Each specific response then contains an `output` object with details relevant to that particular Google Sheets operation, along with `metadata` about the spreadsheet itself.
    *   The `GoogleSheetsResponse` type then acts as a handy umbrella for *any* of these specific responses.

By using interfaces, the file clearly delineates what information is available or required for different scenarios, making the complex API interactions more predictable and easier to manage in code.

### **3. Explaining Each Line of Code**

Let's break down each part of the file:

#### `import type { ToolResponse } from '@/tools/types'`

*   **`import type`**: This is a TypeScript-specific import syntax that ensures only the *type* information (not actual JavaScript code) for `ToolResponse` is imported. This helps prevent unnecessary code bundling in the final JavaScript output.
*   **`{ ToolResponse }`**: `ToolResponse` is an interface expected to be defined in another file (`@/tools/types`). It likely serves as a base interface for all responses from various "tools" in the system, providing common properties like `status`, `errorMessage`, `toolName`, etc. All specific Google Sheets responses will build upon this foundation.
*   **`from '@/tools/types'`**: Specifies the path to the file where `ToolResponse` is defined. The `@/` prefix usually indicates an alias for a common source directory in a project.

---

#### `export interface GoogleSheetsRange { ... }`

This interface describes a specific block of data (a range of cells) within a Google Sheet, including its location and content.

*   **`export interface GoogleSheetsRange`**: Declares an interface named `GoogleSheetsRange`, making it available for use in other files.
*   **`sheetId?: number`**: An optional (`?`) property for the unique numerical ID of the sheet within the spreadsheet. Useful when a spreadsheet has multiple sheets.
*   **`sheetName?: string`**: An optional property for the human-readable name of the sheet (e.g., "Sheet1", "Expenses").
*   **`range: string`**: A **required** string defining the cell range in A1 notation (e.g., `"A1:B5"`, `"Sheet1!C:C"`, `"Sheet2!1:1"`). This specifies *where* the data is.
*   **`values: any[][]`**: A **required** two-dimensional array (`any[][]`) where the outer array represents rows, and the inner arrays represent cells within those rows. `any` is used here to indicate that the cells can contain various types of data (strings, numbers, booleans, etc.) as read from or written to a sheet.

---

#### `export interface GoogleSheetsMetadata { ... }`

This interface defines high-level descriptive information about an entire Google Spreadsheet.

*   **`export interface GoogleSheetsMetadata`**: Declares an interface for spreadsheet metadata.
*   **`spreadsheetId: string`**: The **required** unique identifier string for the Google Spreadsheet itself (e.g., `1Bsd...c_o_jQ`).
*   **`spreadsheetUrl?: string`**: An optional URL string that points directly to the Google Spreadsheet in a web browser.
*   **`title?: string`**: An optional string for the human-readable title of the spreadsheet.
*   **`sheets?: { ... }[]`**: An optional array of objects, where each object describes one individual sheet within the spreadsheet.
    *   **`sheetId: number`**: The unique numerical ID of a specific sheet.
    *   **`title: string`**: The name of that specific sheet (e.g., "Main Data").
    *   **`index: number`**: The zero-based index of the sheet within the spreadsheet (e.g., the first sheet is `0`, the second is `1`).
    *   **`rowCount?: number`**: An optional total number of rows in that specific sheet.
    *   **`columnCount?: number`**: An optional total number of columns in that specific sheet.

---

#### `export interface GoogleSheetsReadResponse extends ToolResponse { ... }`

This interface defines the structure of a response after a successful operation to **read data** from a Google Sheet.

*   **`export interface GoogleSheetsReadResponse extends ToolResponse`**: Declares an interface `GoogleSheetsReadResponse` that inherits all properties from the `ToolResponse` interface (e.g., `status`, `error`).
*   **`output: { ... }`**: A required property named `output` which is an object containing the specific results of the read operation.
    *   **`data: GoogleSheetsRange`**: This property holds the actual data that was read, structured according to the `GoogleSheetsRange` interface (including the `range` and `values`).
    *   **`metadata: GoogleSheetsMetadata`**: This property provides general information about the spreadsheet from which the data was read, structured by the `GoogleSheetsMetadata` interface.

---

#### `export interface GoogleSheetsWriteResponse extends ToolResponse { ... }`

This interface defines the structure of a response after a successful operation to **write data** to (overwriting existing cells) a Google Sheet.

*   **`export interface GoogleSheetsWriteResponse extends ToolResponse`**: Declares an interface for writing response, extending `ToolResponse`.
*   **`output: { ... }`**: An object containing the specific results of the write operation.
    *   **`updatedRange: string`**: A string indicating the A1 notation range that was affected by the write operation (e.g., `"Sheet1!A1:B5"`).
    *   **`updatedRows: number`**: The number of rows that were updated.
    *   **`updatedColumns: number`**: The number of columns that were updated.
    *   **`updatedCells: number`**: The total number of individual cells that had their values changed.
    *   **`metadata: GoogleSheetsMetadata`**: Information about the spreadsheet where data was written.

---

#### `export interface GoogleSheetsUpdateResponse extends ToolResponse { ... }`

This interface defines the structure of a response after a successful operation to **update data** in a Google Sheet. Functionally, it's often very similar to a "write" operation in how APIs are structured, focusing on modifying existing data.

*   **`export interface GoogleSheetsUpdateResponse extends ToolResponse`**: Declares an interface for updating response, extending `ToolResponse`.
*   **`output: { ... }`**: An object containing the specific results of the update operation. Its properties are identical to `GoogleSheetsWriteResponse`, signifying that update and write operations typically return the same kind of summary information about changes.
    *   **`updatedRange: string`**: The range affected.
    *   **`updatedRows: number`**: Number of updated rows.
    *   **`updatedColumns: number`**: Number of updated columns.
    *   **`updatedCells: number`**: Total updated cells.
    *   **`metadata: GoogleSheetsMetadata`**: Information about the spreadsheet.

---

#### `export interface GoogleSheetsAppendResponse extends ToolResponse { ... }`

This interface defines the structure of a response after a successful operation to **append data** (add new rows or columns, typically at the end) to a Google Sheet.

*   **`export interface GoogleSheetsAppendResponse extends ToolResponse`**: Declares an interface for appending response, extending `ToolResponse`.
*   **`output: { ... }`**: An object containing the specific results of the append operation.
    *   **`tableRange: string`**: A string indicating the A1 notation range of the overall table *after* the append operation (e.g., if you appended to `A1:B5`, the table range might now be `A1:B7`).
    *   **`updatedRange: string`**: The specific range where the new data was appended.
    *   **`updatedRows: number`**: Number of rows added/affected by the append.
    *   **`updatedColumns: number`**: Number of columns added/affected by the append.
    *   **`updatedCells: number`**: Total number of new cells created/populated.
    *   **`metadata: GoogleSheetsMetadata`**: Information about the spreadsheet where data was appended.

---

#### `export interface GoogleSheetsToolParams { ... }`

This interface defines the **input parameters** that would be provided to the Google Sheets "tool" to instruct it to perform an action.

*   **`export interface GoogleSheetsToolParams`**: Declares an interface for the parameters needed for a Google Sheets tool operation.
*   **`accessToken: string`**: A **required** string representing the OAuth 2.0 access token needed to authenticate and authorize the Google Sheets API request.
*   **`spreadsheetId: string`**: A **required** string for the unique ID of the target Google Spreadsheet.
*   **`range?: string`**: An optional A1 notation string specifying the specific cell range to operate on (e.g., for reading from, writing to).
*   **`values?: any[][]`**: An optional 2D array of data to be written or appended to the sheet.
*   **`valueInputOption?: 'RAW' | 'USER_ENTERED'`**: An optional property defining how the `values` data should be interpreted by Google Sheets.
    *   `'RAW'`: Values are inserted exactly as they appear (e.g., `'=SUM(A1:A2)'` would be inserted as a string, not evaluated).
    *   `'USER_ENTERED'`: Values are parsed as if entered manually into the Google Sheets UI (e.g., `'=SUM(A1:A2)'` would be evaluated as a formula, `'1/1/2023'` would be interpreted as a date).
*   **`insertDataOption?: 'OVERWRITE' | 'INSERT_ROWS'`**: An optional property for append operations, determining how existing data is handled.
    *   `'OVERWRITE'`: Existing cells in the specified range are overwritten.
    *   `'INSERT_ROWS'`: New rows are inserted to accommodate the new data, pushing existing rows down.
*   **`includeValuesInResponse?: boolean`**: An optional boolean indicating whether the actual cell values should be included in the response when an operation is performed.
*   **`responseValueRenderOption?: 'FORMATTED_VALUE' | 'UNFORMATTED_VALUE' | 'FORMULA'`**: An optional property for read operations, specifying how values in the response should be rendered.
    *   `'FORMATTED_VALUE'`: Returns values as they appear in the UI, including formatting (e.g., currency symbols, date formats).
    *   `'UNFORMATTED_VALUE'`: Returns raw, unformatted values (e.g., `45000` instead of `$45,000`).
    *   `'FORMULA'`: Returns the formulas themselves (e.g., `'=SUM(A1:A2)'`) instead of their calculated results.
*   **`majorDimension?: 'ROWS' | 'COLUMNS'`**: An optional property indicating how the data is organized.
    *   `'ROWS'`: The primary grouping is by rows (i.e., `values` array's outer dimension are rows).
    *   `'COLUMNS'`: The primary grouping is by columns (i.e., `values` array's outer dimension are columns).

---

#### `export type GoogleSheetsResponse = ...`

This is a **union type**, which combines all the possible successful response types into a single, comprehensive type.

*   **`export type GoogleSheetsResponse =`**: Declares a new type alias named `GoogleSheetsResponse`.
*   **`| GoogleSheetsReadResponse`**: This means `GoogleSheetsResponse` can be a `GoogleSheetsReadResponse`.
*   **`| GoogleSheetsWriteResponse`**: Or it can be a `GoogleSheetsWriteResponse`.
*   **`| GoogleSheetsUpdateResponse`**: Or it can be a `GoogleSheetsUpdateResponse`.
*   **`| GoogleSheetsAppendResponse`**: Or it can be a `GoogleSheetsAppendResponse`.

This type is extremely useful when writing functions that might perform any of these Google Sheets operations. You can declare the function's return type as `GoogleSheetsResponse`, and TypeScript will correctly enforce that the function returns one of these specific structures. You can then use type narrowing (e.g., `if ('data' in response.output)`) to determine which specific response type you've received at runtime.
