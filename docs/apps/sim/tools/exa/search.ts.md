This file defines a "tool" named `searchTool` which acts as a standardized interface for interacting with the Exa AI web search service. It's designed to be used within a larger system (like an AI agent framework or a tool-calling application) that can understand and execute such tool configurations.

In essence, this file tells the system:
1.  **What this tool is:** `Exa Search`
2.  **What inputs it needs:** Query, API key, optional parameters like number of results, etc.
3.  **How to call the Exa API:** The specific URL, HTTP method, headers, and how to construct the request body.
4.  **How to process the API's response:** Transform the raw JSON response into a consistent, easy-to-use format.
5.  **What kind of output to expect:** A schema defining the structure of the search results (titles, URLs, snippets, etc.).

### Simplified Complex Logic

The most "complex" parts here are not about advanced algorithms, but about the *structure* used to describe the tool:

*   **`ToolConfig` as a Blueprint:** Imagine `ToolConfig` is a universal template for defining any external service (like a weather API, a calculator, or in this case, a search engine). This file fills out that template specifically for Exa Search. It enforces a consistent way to describe inputs (`params`), how to make the actual call (`request`), and what the output looks like (`outputs` and `transformResponse`).

*   **Dynamic Request Generation:** Notice that `request.headers` and `request.body` are not fixed objects, but *functions*. This is key! It means that when someone actually wants to use this `searchTool`, they provide their specific `query`, `apiKey`, etc., and these functions then dynamically construct the correct HTTP headers and request body for *that specific search request*. This makes the tool flexible and reusable.

*   **`transformResponse` for Consistency:** Raw API responses can sometimes be messy or inconsistent. The `transformResponse` function acts as a clean-up and standardization layer. It takes whatever the Exa API sends back and reshapes it into a predictable, well-defined format, making it easier for the rest of your application (or an AI agent) to consume the results without knowing the Exa API's exact internal structure. It also handles potential missing fields gracefully by providing default empty strings.

### Line-by-Line Explanation

```typescript
import type { ExaSearchParams, ExaSearchResponse } from '@/tools/exa/types'
import type { ToolConfig } from '@/tools/types'
```
*   **Purpose:** These lines import TypeScript *type definitions*.
*   `import type { ExaSearchParams, ExaSearchResponse } from '@/tools/exa/types'`: Imports types that define the structure of the parameters (inputs) for an Exa search and the expected structure of the response from an Exa search. The `type` keyword ensures these imports are only used during type-checking and don't generate any JavaScript code at runtime.
*   `import type { ToolConfig } from '@/tools/types'`: Imports the generic `ToolConfig` type, which is the blueprint for defining any tool in the system.

```typescript
export const searchTool: ToolConfig<ExaSearchParams, ExaSearchResponse> = {
```
*   **Purpose:** Declares and exports the `searchTool` constant, explicitly typing it.
*   `export const searchTool`: Defines a constant variable named `searchTool` and makes it available for other files to import and use.
*   `: ToolConfig<ExaSearchParams, ExaSearchResponse>`: This is a TypeScript type annotation. It specifies that `searchTool` *must* conform to the `ToolConfig` interface. The `<ExaSearchParams, ExaSearchResponse>` part indicates that this specific `ToolConfig` instance will take `ExaSearchParams` as its input parameters and produce output that conforms to `ExaSearchResponse` (after transformation).

```typescript
  id: 'exa_search',
  name: 'Exa Search',
  description:
    'Search the web using Exa AI. Returns relevant search results with titles, URLs, and text snippets.',
  version: '1.0.0',
```
*   **Purpose:** Provides basic metadata about the tool.
*   `id: 'exa_search'`: A unique string identifier for this tool within the system.
*   `name: 'Exa Search'`: A human-readable name for the tool.
*   `description: 'Search the web using Exa AI. ...'`: A longer, descriptive text explaining what the tool does. This is often used for documentation or for AI models to understand the tool's capabilities.
*   `version: '1.0.0'`: The version number of this specific tool definition.

```typescript
  params: {
    query: {
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
      visibility: 'user-or-llm',
      description: 'The search query to execute',
    },
    numResults: {
      type: 'number',
      required: false,
      visibility: 'user-only',
      description: 'Number of results to return (default: 10, max: 25)',
    },
    useAutoprompt: {
      type: 'boolean',
      required: false,
      visibility: 'user-only',
      description: 'Whether to use autoprompt to improve the query (default: false)',
    },
    type: {
      type: 'string',
      required: false,
      visibility: 'user-only',
      description: 'Search type: neural, keyword, auto or fast (default: auto)',
    },
    apiKey: {
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
      visibility: 'user-only',
      description: 'Exa AI API Key',
    },
  },
```
*   **Purpose:** This `params` object defines all the input parameters (arguments) that the `searchTool` can accept. Each parameter specifies its type, whether it's mandatory, who can provide it, and a description.
*   `query`:
    *   `type: 'string'`: The input must be a string (text).
    *   `required: true`: This parameter *must* be provided for the tool to function.
    *   `visibility: 'user-or-llm'`: Indicates that either a human user or a Large Language Model (LLM) can provide the value for this parameter.
    *   `description: 'The search query to execute'`: Explains what the `query` parameter is for.
*   `numResults`:
    *   `type: 'number'`: The input must be a number.
    *   `required: false`: This parameter is optional. If not provided, a default will likely be used by the Exa API (e.g., 10).
    *   `visibility: 'user-only'`: Suggests this parameter is typically set by a human user, not automatically by an LLM.
    *   `description: 'Number of results to return (default: 10, max: 25)'`: Explains the parameter and its constraints.
*   `useAutoprompt`, `type`: Similar to `numResults`, these are optional parameters primarily for user control.
*   `apiKey`:
    *   `type: 'string'`: A string.
    *   `required: true`: This is mandatory, as it's needed for authentication with the Exa API.
    *   `visibility: 'user-only'`: The API key is a sensitive credential and should be provided by the user, not generated or inferred by an LLM.
    *   `description: 'Exa AI API Key'`: Clearly states its purpose.

```typescript
  request: {
    url: 'https://api.exa.ai/search',
    method: 'POST',
    headers: (params) => ({
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'x-api-key': params.apiKey,
    }),
    body: (params) => {
      const body: Record<string, any> = {
        query: params.query,
      }

      // Add optional parameters if provided
      if (params.numResults) body.numResults = params.numResults
      if (params.useAutoprompt !== undefined) body.useAutoprompt = params.useAutoprompt
      if (params.type) body.type = params.type

      return body
    },
  },
```
*   **Purpose:** This `request` object specifies how to construct and send the actual HTTP request to the Exa AI API.
*   `url: 'https://api.exa.ai/search'`: The specific URL endpoint for the Exa search API.
*   `method: 'POST'`: The HTTP method to use (in this case, sending data to the server).
*   `headers: (params) => ({ ... })`: This is a *function* that takes the `params` (the tool's input) and returns an object representing the HTTP request headers.
    *   `'Content-Type': 'application/json'`: Informs the server that the request body will be in JSON format.
    *   `'x-api-key': params.apiKey`: Dynamically sets the `x-api-key` header using the `apiKey` value provided in the `params` when the tool is executed. This is for authentication.
*   `body: (params) => { ... }`: This is another *function* that takes the `params` and constructs the HTTP request body (which will be sent as JSON).
    *   `const body: Record<string, any> = { query: params.query, }`: Initializes a JavaScript object named `body` with the mandatory `query` parameter. `Record<string, any>` is a TypeScript type indicating an object with string keys and any type of values.
    *   `if (params.numResults) body.numResults = params.numResults`: If the `numResults` parameter was provided (it's not `null`, `undefined`, or `0`), add it to the `body` object.
    *   `if (params.useAutoprompt !== undefined) body.useAutoprompt = params.useAutoprompt`: If `useAutoprompt` was provided (even if its value is `false`, which is a falsy value, so we specifically check for `!== undefined` to include `false`), add it to the `body`.
    *   `if (params.type) body.type = params.type`: If the `type` parameter was provided, add it to the `body`.
    *   `return body`: Returns the constructed object, which will then be serialized into JSON and sent as the request body.

```typescript
  transformResponse: async (response: Response) => {
    const data = await response.json()

    return {
      success: true,
      output: {
        results: data.results.map((result: any) => ({
          title: result.title || '',
          url: result.url,
          publishedDate: result.publishedDate,
          author: result.author,
          summary: result.summary,
          favicon: result.favicon,
          image: result.image,
          text: result.text,
          score: result.score,
        })),
      },
    }
  },
```
*   **Purpose:** This asynchronous function processes the raw HTTP response received from the Exa API and transforms it into a standardized output format.
*   `async (response: Response) => { ... }`: Declares an asynchronous function that takes an `HTTP Response` object as input.
*   `const data = await response.json()`: Asynchronously parses the body of the `Response` object as JSON and stores the resulting JavaScript object in `data`.
*   `return { success: true, output: { ... } }`: Returns a structured object.
    *   `success: true`: A flag indicating that the API call and transformation were successful.
    *   `output`: Contains the actual data returned by the tool.
    *   `results: data.results.map((result: any) => ({ ... }))`: This is a crucial line. It takes the `results` array from the raw API response (`data.results`) and uses the `map` method to create a *new* array. For each `result` object in the original array:
        *   It creates a new object with specific properties (`title`, `url`, `publishedDate`, etc.).
        *   `title: result.title || ''`: Extracts the `title`. If `result.title` is `null` or `undefined`, it defaults to an empty string `''` to ensure consistency.
        *   Other properties like `url`, `publishedDate`, `author`, `summary`, `favicon`, `image`, `text`, `score` are directly extracted. This ensures the output structure is consistent regardless of the exact format of the raw Exa API response.

```typescript
  outputs: {
    results: {
      type: 'array',
      description: 'Search results with titles, URLs, and text snippets',
      items: {
        type: 'object',
        properties: {
          title: { type: 'string', description: 'The title of the search result' },
          url: { type: 'string', description: 'The URL of the search result' },
          publishedDate: { type: 'string', description: 'Date when the content was published' },
          author: { type: 'string', description: 'The author of the content' },
          summary: { type: 'string', description: 'A brief summary of the content' },
          favicon: { type: 'string', description: "URL of the site's favicon" },
          image: { type: 'string', description: 'URL of a representative image from the page' },
          text: { type: 'string', description: 'Text snippet or full content from the page' },
          score: { type: 'number', description: 'Relevance score for the search result' },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```
*   **Purpose:** This `outputs` object formally defines the expected structure and types of the data that the tool will return *after* the `transformResponse` function has processed it. This is essentially a schema for the tool's output.
*   `results`:
    *   `type: 'array'`: Specifies that the `results` property will be an array.
    *   `description: 'Search results with titles, URLs, and text snippets'`: A description of what this array contains.
    *   `items`: Describes the structure of each individual item *within* the `results` array.
        *   `type: 'object'`: Each item in the array will be an object.
        *   `properties`: Defines the specific properties that each object in the `results` array will have.
            *   `title: { type: 'string', description: '...' }`: Indicates that `title` will be a string and provides a description.
            *   `url: { type: 'string', description: '...' }`: Indicates `url` will be a string and provides a description.
            *   `publishedDate`, `author`, `summary`, `favicon`, `image`, `text`: All are defined as `string` types with their respective descriptions.
            *   `score: { type: 'number', description: '...' }`: Indicates `score` will be a number and provides a description.

This detailed schema is valuable for automated validation, generating documentation, or allowing AI models to precisely understand the output they can expect from calling the `Exa Search` tool.
