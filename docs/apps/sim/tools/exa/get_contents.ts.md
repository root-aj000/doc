This TypeScript code defines a "tool" configuration for interacting with the Exa AI API to retrieve the contents of web pages. It's designed to be plug-and-play within a larger system (likely an AI agent framework or a similar tool orchestration platform) that can understand and execute such configurations.

## Detailed Explanation: Exa Get Contents Tool

This file defines a reusable "tool" called `getContentsTool`. Its primary purpose is to provide a structured way for a larger application or an AI agent to request web page content (including titles, full text, and AI-generated summaries) from the Exa AI service. It handles all the details of constructing the API request, authenticating, and then processing the raw API response into a clean, predictable output format.

### Why is this structured this way?

Imagine you have an AI assistant that can do many things, like search the web, generate images, or fetch data. Each of these capabilities is a "tool." This file is essentially the instruction manual for *one specific tool*: how to "Get Contents" from web pages using Exa AI.

This structured format (using `ToolConfig`) makes it easy for the overarching system to:
1.  **Discover** what tools are available.
2.  **Understand** what parameters each tool accepts.
3.  **Know** how to make the actual API call.
4.  **Anticipate** what kind of data the tool will return.

### Code Breakdown

Let's go through the code section by section.

---

```typescript
import type { ExaGetContentsParams, ExaGetContentsResponse } from '@/tools/exa/types'
import type { ToolConfig } from '@/tools/types'
```

*   **`import type { ExaGetContentsParams, ExaGetContentsResponse } from '@/tools/exa/types'`**: This line imports TypeScript `type` definitions.
    *   `ExaGetContentsParams`: Specifies the expected structure of the input parameters *for this specific Exa contents tool*. It ensures we pass the correct data to the Exa API.
    *   `ExaGetContentsResponse`: Specifies the expected structure of the response *received from the Exa contents API*. This helps in correctly handling the API's reply.
    *   The `@/tools/exa/types` path suggests these types are defined in a separate file within the project, making the code modular and organized.
*   **`import type { ToolConfig } from '@/tools/types'`**: This line imports the generic `ToolConfig` type.
    *   `ToolConfig`: This is a blueprint that defines the overall structure expected for *any* tool in the system. By adhering to this type, `getContentsTool` guarantees it has all the necessary properties (like `id`, `name`, `params`, `request`, etc.) to function as a tool.

---

```typescript
export const getContentsTool: ToolConfig<ExaGetContentsParams, ExaGetContentsResponse> = {
  // ... tool configuration properties ...
};
```

*   **`export const getContentsTool: ToolConfig<ExaGetContentsParams, ExaGetContentsResponse> = { ... }`**: This line declares and exports a constant variable named `getContentsTool`.
    *   `export`: Makes this `getContentsTool` object available for other files in the project to import and use.
    *   `const`: Indicates that `getContentsTool` is a constant and its value (the configuration object) cannot be reassigned after its initial declaration.
    *   `: ToolConfig<ExaGetContentsParams, ExaGetContentsResponse>`: This is a TypeScript type annotation. It tells us that `getContentsTool` must conform to the `ToolConfig` structure. The `<ExaGetContentsParams, ExaGetContentsResponse>` part specifies that this particular `ToolConfig` expects `ExaGetContentsParams` as its input parameters and will ultimately produce a result shaped like `ExaGetContentsResponse` (though the `transformResponse` step might convert it slightly for the final output).

---

### Basic Tool Information (Metadata)

```typescript
  id: 'exa_get_contents',
  name: 'Exa Get Contents',
  description:
    'Retrieve the contents of webpages using Exa AI. Returns the title, text content, and optional summaries for each URL.',
  version: '1.0.0',
```

*   **`id: 'exa_get_contents'`**: A unique identifier for this tool within the system. This is crucial for distinguishing it from other tools.
*   **`name: 'Exa Get Contents'`**: A human-readable name for the tool, often displayed in user interfaces or logs.
*   **`description: 'Retrieve the contents of webpages using Exa AI. Returns the title, text content, and optional summaries for each URL.'`**: A clear explanation of what the tool does. This is vital for documentation and for AI models to understand when to use this tool.
*   **`version: '1.0.0'`**: The version number of this tool's configuration. Useful for tracking changes and compatibility.

---

### Input Parameters (`params`)

This section defines the arguments or inputs that a user or an AI model can provide to use this tool. Each parameter has specific properties:

```typescript
  params: {
    urls: {
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
      visibility: 'user-or-llm',
      description: 'Comma-separated list of URLs to retrieve content from',
    },
    text: {
      type: 'boolean',
      required: false,
      visibility: 'user-only',
      description:
        'If true, returns full page text with default settings. If false, disables text return.',
    },
    summaryQuery: {
      type: 'string',
      required: false,
      visibility: 'user-or-llm',
      description: 'Query to guide the summary generation',
    },
    apiKey: {
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
      visibility: 'user-only',
      description: 'Exa AI API Key',
    },
  },
```

*   **`params: { ... }`**: This object contains the definitions for all the input parameters this tool accepts.
    *   **`urls: { ... }`**:
        *   `type: 'string'`: The input for `urls` should be a string.
        *   `required: true`: This parameter *must* be provided for the tool to function.
        *   `visibility: 'user-or-llm'`: Both human users and Language Model Models (LLMs) are expected to be able to provide this parameter.
        *   `description: 'Comma-separated list of URLs to retrieve content from'`: Explains the expected format and purpose of the `urls` input.
    *   **`text: { ... }`**:
        *   `type: 'boolean'`: The input for `text` should be `true` or `false`.
        *   `required: false`: This parameter is optional. If not provided, a default behavior will apply.
        *   `visibility: 'user-only'`: This parameter is typically controlled by a human user, not an AI model. This might be for sensitive settings or those that require explicit user consent.
        *   `description: 'If true, returns full page text with default settings. If false, disables text return.'`: Explains what this boolean flag does.
    *   **`summaryQuery: { ... }`**:
        *   `type: 'string'`: The input for `summaryQuery` should be a string.
        *   `required: false`: This parameter is optional.
        *   `visibility: 'user-or-llm'`: Both human users and LLMs can provide this. An LLM might generate a query to guide the summary.
        *   `description: 'Query to guide the summary generation'`: Explains that this text helps Exa AI focus its summary.
    *   **`apiKey: { ... }`**:
        *   `type: 'string'`: The input for `apiKey` should be a string.
        *   `required: true`: This parameter is mandatory.
        *   `visibility: 'user-only'`: Similar to `text`, this is typically provided by the user (or the system on their behalf) and not directly by an LLM, as API keys are sensitive.
        *   `description: 'Exa AI API Key'`: Self-explanatory.

### Request Configuration (`request`)

This section details how to construct and send the actual HTTP request to the Exa AI API.

```typescript
  request: {
    url: 'https://api.exa.ai/contents',
    method: 'POST',
    headers: (params) => ({
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'x-api-key': params.apiKey,
    }),
    body: (params) => {
      // Parse the comma-separated URLs into an array
      const urlsString = params.urls
      const urlArray = urlsString
        .split(',')
        .map((url: string) => url.trim())
        .filter((url: string) => url.length > 0)

      const body: Record<string, any> = {
        urls: urlArray,
      }

      // Add optional parameters if provided
      if (params.text !== undefined) {
        body.text = params.text
      }

      // Add summary with query if provided
      if (params.summaryQuery) {
        body.summary = {
          query: params.summaryQuery,
        }
      }

      return body
    },
  },
```

*   **`request: { ... }`**: This object holds the configuration for the HTTP request.
    *   **`url: 'https://api.exa.ai/contents'`**: The specific endpoint URL of the Exa AI API to which the request will be sent.
    *   **`method: 'POST'`**: Specifies that this will be an HTTP POST request, which is typically used for sending data to a server.
    *   **`headers: (params) => ({ ... })`**: This is a function that dynamically generates the HTTP headers for the request. It takes the `params` (input parameters to the tool) as an argument.
        *   `'Content-Type': 'application/json'`: A standard header indicating that the body of the request will be in JSON format.
        *   `'x-api-key': params.apiKey`: This is how the API key is passed for authentication. `params.apiKey` refers to the `apiKey` provided as an input parameter to the tool.
    *   **`body: (params) => { ... }`**: This is a function that constructs the *request body* (the data payload) that will be sent with the POST request. It also takes the `params` provided to the tool.
        *   `const urlsString = params.urls`: Retrieves the raw `urls` string from the input parameters.
        *   **Simplified Logic: URL Parsing Chain**
            ```typescript
            const urlArray = urlsString
              .split(',')
              .map((url: string) => url.trim())
              .filter((url: string) => url.length > 0)
            ```
            This chain of methods cleans and processes the `urls` string:
            1.  `urlsString.split(',')`: Splits the comma-separated string into an array of individual URL strings. For example, `"url1, url2"` becomes `["url1", " url2"]`.
            2.  `.map((url: string) => url.trim())`: Iterates over each string in the array and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. So, `["url1", " url2"]` becomes `["url1", "url2"]`.
            3.  `.filter((url: string) => url.length > 0)`: Removes any empty strings that might have resulted from extra commas (e.g., `",url1,,url2"` would produce empty strings after splitting, which are then filtered out).
            The result (`urlArray`) is a clean array of valid URLs ready for the API.
        *   `const body: Record<string, any> = { urls: urlArray, }`: Initializes the JSON request body. `Record<string, any>` is a TypeScript utility type for an object where keys are strings and values can be any type. The `urls` property is set to the `urlArray` we just prepared.
        *   `if (params.text !== undefined) { body.text = params.text }`: If the `text` parameter was explicitly provided (meaning it's not `undefined`), its value is added to the request body. This allows sending `text: true` or `text: false`.
        *   `if (params.summaryQuery) { body.summary = { query: params.summaryQuery, } }`: If the `summaryQuery` parameter was provided (meaning it's not `null`, `undefined`, or an empty string), an object `{ query: params.summaryQuery }` is added under a `summary` property in the request body. This is how the Exa AI API expects a summary query.
        *   `return body`: Returns the fully constructed JSON object, which will be sent as the request body.

### Response Transformation (`transformResponse`)

This function takes the raw response from the Exa AI API and processes it into a standardized, easy-to-use format for the tool's output.

```typescript
  transformResponse: async (response: Response) => {
    const data = await response.json()

    return {
      success: true,
      output: {
        results: data.results.map((result: any) => ({
          url: result.url,
          title: result.title || '',
          text: result.text || '',
          summary: result.summary || '',
        })),
      },
    }
  },
```

*   **`transformResponse: async (response: Response) => { ... }`**: This is an `async` function that takes the raw `Response` object received from the HTTP request.
    *   `const data = await response.json()`: The `response.json()` method parses the HTTP response body as JSON. Since this is an asynchronous operation (it might take time to read the full body), `await` pauses the function execution until the JSON parsing is complete, and `data` will then hold the parsed JavaScript object.
    *   **Simplified Logic: Standardizing Output**
        ```typescript
        return {
          success: true,
          output: {
            results: data.results.map((result: any) => ({
              url: result.url,
              title: result.title || '',
              text: result.text || '',
              summary: result.summary || '',
            })),
          },
        }
        ```
        This returns a standard object indicating the success of the operation and containing the `output`.
        *   `success: true`: A boolean flag indicating that the tool executed successfully.
        *   `output: { ... }`: This object contains the actual results.
        *   `results: data.results.map((result: any) => ({ ... }))`: The Exa AI API typically returns an array of content items under a `results` property (`data.results`). This `.map()` function iterates over each `result` item from the API and transforms it into a cleaner, more consistent format:
            *   `url: result.url`: Takes the URL directly from the API response.
            *   `title: result.title || ''`: Takes the title. The `|| ''` (logical OR with an empty string) is a common JavaScript pattern to provide a default value if `result.title` is `null`, `undefined`, or an empty string. This ensures the `title` property is *always* a string, even if Exa AI doesn't return one.
            *   `text: result.text || ''`: Same logic as `title`, ensuring `text` is always a string.
            *   `summary: result.summary || ''`: Same logic as `title`, ensuring `summary` is always a string.

---

### Output Schema (`outputs`)

This section formally defines the structure and types of the data that this tool will *output* after its `transformResponse` step. This is useful for systems consuming the tool's results, ensuring they know what to expect.

```typescript
  outputs: {
    results: {
      type: 'array',
      description: 'Retrieved content from URLs with title, text, and summaries',
      items: {
        type: 'object',
        properties: {
          url: { type: 'string', description: 'The URL that content was retrieved from' },
          title: { type: 'string', description: 'The title of the webpage' },
          text: { type: 'string', description: 'The full text content of the webpage' },
          summary: { type: 'string', description: 'AI-generated summary of the webpage content' },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

*   **`outputs: { ... }`**: This object describes the structure of the data returned by the tool.
    *   **`results: { ... }`**: This defines the `results` property in the `output` from `transformResponse`.
        *   `type: 'array'`: Specifies that `results` will be an array.
        *   `description: 'Retrieved content from URLs with title, text, and summaries'`: Describes what the array contains.
        *   `items: { ... }`: This nested object defines the structure of *each individual item* within the `results` array.
            *   `type: 'object'`: Each item in the array is an object.
            *   `properties: { ... }`: This lists the expected properties for each object in the `results` array:
                *   `url: { type: 'string', description: 'The URL that content was retrieved from' }`: Defines the `url` property as a string.
                *   `title: { type: 'string', description: 'The title of the webpage' }`: Defines the `title` property as a string.
                *   `text: { type: 'string', description: 'The full text content of the webpage' }`: Defines the `text` property as a string.
                *   `summary: { type: 'string', description: 'AI-generated summary of the webpage content' }`: Defines the `summary` property as a string.

---

### Summary of the Flow

1.  A system (e.g., an AI agent) wants to get webpage content.
2.  It looks up the `getContentsTool` by its `id`.
3.  It provides the required `params` (like `urls` and `apiKey`) and any optional ones (`text`, `summaryQuery`).
4.  The `request.body` function uses these `params` to construct the JSON payload for the Exa AI API, handling URL parsing and optional parameters.
5.  The `request.headers` function adds the `Content-Type` and `x-api-key` header for authentication.
6.  An HTTP POST request is sent to `https://api.exa.ai/contents`.
7.  Upon receiving the API response, the `transformResponse` function processes it:
    *   It parses the raw JSON.
    *   It then maps the `results` from Exa AI into a consistent format, ensuring properties like `title`, `text`, and `summary` always exist (even if empty).
8.  The final, structured output (matching the `outputs` schema) is returned to the calling system.
