This TypeScript file is a blueprint, defining the exact shapes and structures for all data involved when interacting with various "Exa AI tools." Think of it as a comprehensive dictionary that ensures everyone (both humans and computers) uses the correct terms and formats when requesting information from these tools or receiving results back.

Let's break it down into easy-to-understand parts.

---

### **1. Purpose of this File**

The primary goal of this `types.ts` file is to establish a **strongly typed contract** for the Exa AI tool ecosystem. In simpler terms, it defines:

*   **What kind of information you need to send** to each Exa AI tool (e.g., what parameters a search query requires).
*   **What kind of information you'll receive back** from each tool (e.g., what fields a search result will have).

By doing this, TypeScript provides several benefits:

*   **Type Safety**: Prevents common coding errors by catching mismatched data types *before* you even run your code.
*   **Autocompletion & Documentation**: Your code editor can intelligently suggest properties and parameters, making development faster and reducing the need to constantly look up API documentation.
*   **Readability & Maintainability**: Makes the code clearer and easier for other developers (and your future self!) to understand and modify, as the expected data structures are explicitly defined.

---

### **2. Simplifying Complex Logic**

The core "complexity" here isn't in intricate algorithms, but rather in the **sheer number of data structures** needed to describe different tools. The file organizes these structures logically:

*   **`ExaBaseParams`**: A common foundation for all tool parameters, ensuring every request has an `apiKey`.
*   **`ToolResponse`**: An imported base type (from another file) that all tool responses extend, likely providing common fields like a status or request ID. We'll assume it provides a consistent outer wrapper for responses.
*   **Categorization by Tool**: Each Exa AI tool (Search, Get Contents, Find Similar, Answer, Research) gets its own set of parameter interfaces (`...Params`) and response interfaces (`...Response`), along with interfaces for the individual items they return (`...Result`, `...Link`, `...Citation`).
*   **`ExaResponse` Union Type**: This is a powerful TypeScript feature that says, "an `ExaResponse` can be *any one of* these specific response types." It's like saying, "this box might contain a car, a truck, or a bike, but it definitely won't contain a boat."

---

### **3. Line-by-Line Explanation**

Let's go through the code section by section.

```typescript
// Common types for Exa AI tools
import type { ToolResponse } from '@/tools/types'
```

*   **`// Common types for Exa AI tools`**: This is a comment, providing a helpful description for the file.
*   **`import type { ToolResponse } from '@/tools/types'`**: This line imports a specific type named `ToolResponse` from another file located at `@/tools/types`.
    *   **`import type`**: This is a special TypeScript syntax that indicates you're only importing a *type* (like an interface or a type alias), not actual runnable code. This helps to ensure that your compiled JavaScript won't include unnecessary code that only serves a purpose during type-checking.
    *   **`{ ToolResponse }`**: We are specifically importing the `ToolResponse` type.
    *   **`from '@/tools/types'`**: This specifies the module path from where `ToolResponse` is imported. The `@/` likely indicates a path alias configured in your project (e.g., `tsconfig.json`), mapping to a directory like `src/`. `ToolResponse` is presumed to be a base interface that all Exa AI tool responses will extend, providing common properties like `status` or `requestId`.

```typescript
// Common parameters for all Exa AI tools
export interface ExaBaseParams {
  apiKey: string
}
```

*   **`// Common parameters for all Exa AI tools`**: A comment explaining the purpose of the following interface.
*   **`export interface ExaBaseParams`**:
    *   **`export`**: This keyword makes the `ExaBaseParams` interface available for use in other TypeScript files that import it.
    *   **`interface`**: This declares a TypeScript interface, which is a way to define the shape of an object. It specifies what properties an object must have and what their types should be.
    *   **`ExaBaseParams`**: This is the name of the interface. It stands for "Exa Base Parameters," indicating it holds common parameters.
*   **`apiKey: string`**: This line defines a required property named `apiKey` within the `ExaBaseParams` interface, which must be a `string`. This means any object adhering to `ExaBaseParams` (or an interface that extends it) *must* have an `apiKey` property of type `string`. This is likely for authentication with the Exa AI service.

---

### **Search Tool Types**

This section defines the types for the Exa AI search tool.

```typescript
export interface ExaSearchParams extends ExaBaseParams {
  query: string
  numResults?: number
  useAutoprompt?: boolean
  type?: 'auto' | 'neural' | 'keyword' | 'fast'
}
```

*   **`export interface ExaSearchParams extends ExaBaseParams`**:
    *   **`ExaSearchParams`**: The name for the search tool's parameters.
    *   **`extends ExaBaseParams`**: This means `ExaSearchParams` inherits all properties from `ExaBaseParams`. So, an object of type `ExaSearchParams` will automatically include an `apiKey: string` in addition to its own defined properties. This promotes code reuse and consistency.
*   **`query: string`**: A required property for the search query, which must be a `string`.
*   **`numResults?: number`**:
    *   **`numResults`**: The name of the property.
    *   **`?`**: The question mark makes this property *optional*. You don't have to provide it when creating an `ExaSearchParams` object.
    *   **`number`**: If provided, `numResults` must be a `number`. It likely specifies the maximum number of search results to return.
*   **`useAutoprompt?: boolean`**: An optional property, which, if provided, must be a `boolean` (true or false). This might control an AI-driven prompt enhancement feature.
*   **`type?: 'auto' | 'neural' | 'keyword' | 'fast'`**:
    *   An optional property named `type`.
    *   **`'auto' | 'neural' | 'keyword' | 'fast'`**: This is a **union type of string literal types**. It means that if `type` is provided, its value must be *one of these exact strings*. It cannot be any other string. This limits the possible search strategies.

```typescript
export interface ExaSearchResult {
  title: string
  url: string
  publishedDate?: string
  author?: string
  summary?: string
  favicon?: string
  image?: string
  text: string
  score: number
}
```

*   **`export interface ExaSearchResult`**: Defines the shape of a single search result item.
*   **`title: string`**: The required title of the search result (e.g., webpage title).
*   **`url: string`**: The required URL of the search result.
*   **`publishedDate?: string`**: Optional date of publication, as a `string`.
*   **`author?: string`**: Optional author of the content.
*   **`summary?: string`**: Optional summary of the content.
*   **`favicon?: string`**: Optional URL for the website's favicon.
*   **`image?: string`**: Optional URL for a relevant image.
*   **`text: string`**: The required full text content of the search result.
*   **`score: number`**: The required relevance score of the result, as a `number`.

```typescript
export interface ExaSearchResponse extends ToolResponse {
  output: {
    results: ExaSearchResult[]
  }
}
```

*   **`export interface ExaSearchResponse extends ToolResponse`**: Defines the full response structure for a search query, extending the common `ToolResponse` interface.
*   **`output: { ... }`**: This defines a required property named `output`, which itself is an object. This `output` object acts as a container for the actual search results.
*   **`results: ExaSearchResult[]`**: Inside the `output` object, there's a required property `results`.
    *   **`ExaSearchResult[]`**: This indicates that `results` will be an **array** of `ExaSearchResult` objects. So, a search response will contain a list of individual search results, each conforming to the `ExaSearchResult` interface.

### **Get Contents Tool Types**

This section defines types for a tool that retrieves the full content of specified URLs.

```typescript
export interface ExaGetContentsParams extends ExaBaseParams {
  urls: string
  text?: boolean
  summaryQuery?: string
}
```

*   **`export interface ExaGetContentsParams extends ExaBaseParams`**: Parameters for the "Get Contents" tool, inheriting `apiKey`.
*   **`urls: string`**: Required property, a `string` representing one or more URLs whose content should be retrieved. (It's common for API definitions to use a single string here, expecting a comma-separated list of URLs, for example.)
*   **`text?: boolean`**: Optional flag (true/false) to indicate whether to include the full text content in the response.
*   **`summaryQuery?: string`**: An optional `string` that, if provided, might be used to generate a summary of the content based on this specific query.

```typescript
export interface ExaGetContentsResult {
  url: string
  title: string
  text: string
  summary?: string
}
```

*   **`export interface ExaGetContentsResult`**: Defines the shape of a single content retrieval result.
*   **`url: string`**: The required URL of the retrieved content.
*   **`title: string`**: The required title of the content.
*   **`text: string`**: The required full text of the content.
*   **`summary?: string`**: An optional summary of the content.

```typescript

  output: {
    results: ExaGetContentsResult[]
  }
}
```

*   **`export interface ExaGetContentsResponse extends ToolResponse`**: The full response structure for the "Get Contents" tool, extending `ToolResponse`.
*   **`output: { results: ExaGetContentsResult[] }`**: Similar to the search response, it has an `output` object containing a required `results` array, where each item is an `ExaGetContentsResult`.

    *   **`answer: string`**: The generated answer to the query.
    *   **`citations: { ... }[]`**: A required array of `citations`. Each item in this array is an anonymous object (an object without a named interface) with the following properties:
        *   **`title: string`**: The title of the source document.
        *   **`url: string`**: The URL of the source document.
        *   **`text: string`**: The relevant text snippet from the source document that supports the answer.

### **Research Tool Types**

This section defines types for a research tool, likely for more in-depth information retrieval.

```typescript
export interface ExaResearchParams extends ExaBaseParams {
  query: string
  includeText?: boolean
}
```

*   **`export interface ExaResearchParams extends ExaBaseParams`**: Parameters for the "Research" tool, inheriting `apiKey`.

### **Union Type for All Responses**

```typescript
export type ExaResponse =
  | ExaSearchResponse
  | ExaGetContentsResponse
  | ExaFindSimilarLinksResponse
  | ExaAnswerResponse
  | ExaResearchResponse
```

*   **`export type ExaResponse`**:
    *   **`export`**: Makes this type alias available for import in other files.
    *   **`type`**: This keyword is used to create a **type alias**, which is a new name for an existing type or combination of types.
    *   **`ExaResponse`**: The name of this new type alias.
*   **`=`**: Assigns the definition to the `ExaResponse` type.
*   **`|`**: The **union operator**. This is the key part! It means "or."
*   **`ExaSearchResponse | ExaGetContentsResponse | ... | ExaResearchResponse`**: This line defines `ExaResponse` as a type that can be *any one* of the specified tool response interfaces. If a variable is declared as `ExaResponse`, TypeScript will understand that it might hold a `ExaSearchResponse`, or an `ExaGetContentsResponse`, and so on. This is incredibly useful for functions that might return different types of responses depending on the tool called, allowing for flexible yet type-safe handling.
