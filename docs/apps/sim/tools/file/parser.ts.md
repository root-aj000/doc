This file defines a "Tool" configuration named `fileParserTool` within a larger application framework. Think of it as a blueprint for integrating an external file parsing service into your system. This tool is responsible for sending requests to a backend API that can parse various file types (text, PDF, CSV, images, etc.) and then processing the API's response into a structured, easily consumable format for other parts of the application.

---

### **Purpose of this File**

The primary purpose of `fileParserTool.ts` is to:

1.  **Define a File Parsing Tool:** It registers a reusable "tool" called `fileParserTool` that encapsulates the logic for interacting with a file parsing backend.
2.  **Specify Input Parameters:** It declares what inputs (like `filePath` and `fileType`) this tool expects from users or other parts of the application.
3.  **Handle Request Transformation:** It contains the logic to convert the tool's input parameters into a valid HTTP request body that the `/api/files/parse` endpoint understands, supporting various ways files might be provided (direct path, single upload, multiple uploads).
4.  **Process API Responses:** It defines how to interpret the response from the file parsing API, structuring the parsed file content consistently, whether it's a single file or multiple files, and making it easy to access.
5.  **Declare Output Structure:** It describes the shape of the data that the tool will produce after successfully parsing files, allowing other parts of the system to know what to expect.

In essence, this file acts as an interface layer, abstracting away the complexities of interacting with the file parsing backend and providing a clean, consistent way for the rest of the application to parse files.

### **Detailed Explanation**

Let's break down the code section by section.

#### **Imports and Logger Initialization**

```typescript
import { createLogger } from '@/lib/logs/console/logger'
import type {
  FileParseResult,
  FileParserInput,
  FileParserOutput,
  FileParserOutputData,
} from '@/tools/file/types'
import type { ToolConfig } from '@/tools/types'

const logger = createLogger('FileParserTool')
```

*   **`import { createLogger } from '@/lib/logs/console/logger'`**: This line imports a utility function `createLogger`. This function is used to create a logger instance specifically for this tool, enabling structured logging (e.g., info, warn, error messages) that can be helpful for debugging and monitoring.
*   **`import type { ... } from '@/tools/file/types'`**: This imports several TypeScript `type` definitions specific to file parsing. Using `type` ensures these imports are only for type-checking and don't add any runtime code to the bundle.
    *   `FileParseResult`: Represents the structured output for a single parsed file (e.g., its content, name, metadata).
    *   `FileParserInput`: Defines the expected shape of the input parameters for this file parser tool.
    *   `FileParserOutput`: Defines the overall shape of the output this tool will produce.
    *   `FileParserOutputData`: Defines the specific data payload within `FileParserOutput`.
*   **`import type { ToolConfig } from '@/tools/types'`**: This imports the `ToolConfig` type. This is a generic type that provides the overall structure for defining any "Tool" in the application framework, ensuring consistency across different tool implementations. It's parameterized with the input and output types (`<FileParserInput, FileParserOutput>`) to make it type-safe.
*   **`const logger = createLogger('FileParserTool')`**: This line initializes a logger instance specifically for the `FileParserTool`. All log messages originating from this file will be prefixed with `'FileParserTool'`, making it easier to filter and understand logs.

#### **Tool Configuration (`fileParserTool`)**

This is the main object that defines our file parser tool. It adheres to the `ToolConfig` interface.

```typescript
export const fileParserTool: ToolConfig<FileParserInput, FileParserOutput> = {
  // ... configuration properties
}
```

*   **`export const fileParserTool: ToolConfig<FileParserInput, FileParserOutput> = { ... }`**: This declares and exports a constant variable `fileParserTool`. It's explicitly typed as `ToolConfig<FileParserInput, FileParserOutput>`, ensuring that its structure conforms to the `ToolConfig` definition and that its input and output types are correctly enforced.

Let's look at its properties:

##### **Metadata**

```typescript
  id: 'file_parser',
  name: 'File Parser',
  description: 'Parse one or more uploaded files or files from URLs (text, PDF, CSV, images, etc.)',
  version: '1.0.0',
```

These are basic identifying properties for the tool:

*   **`id: 'file_parser'`**: A unique identifier for this tool within the application.
*   **`name: 'File Parser'`**: A human-readable name for the tool, typically displayed in the UI.
*   **`description: 'Parse one or more uploaded files or files from URLs (text, PDF, CSV, images, etc.)'`**: A brief explanation of what the tool does.
*   **`version: '1.0.0'`**: The version number of this tool configuration.

##### **Parameters (`params`)**

```typescript
  params: {
    filePath: {
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
      visibility: 'user-only',
      description: 'Path to the file(s). Can be a single path, URL, or an array of paths.',
    },
    fileType: {
      type: 'string',
      required: false,
      visibility: 'hidden',
      description: 'Type of file to parse (auto-detected if not specified)',
    },
  },
```

This object defines the input parameters that this tool expects. Each parameter is an object with its own configuration:

*   **`filePath`**:
    *   **`type: 'string'`**: Specifies that `filePath` is expected to be a string. While the description says "array of paths" is possible, the type here indicates the *expected* input to the `params` object itself, which will be processed by the `request.body` function.
    *   **`required: true`**: This parameter is mandatory for the tool to function.
    *   **`visibility: 'user-only'`**: Suggests that this parameter might be exposed to end-users (e.g., in a UI form).
    *   **`description: 'Path to the file(s). Can be a single path, URL, or an array of paths.'`**: A detailed explanation for users on what this parameter should be.
*   **`fileType`**:
    *   **`type: 'string'`**: Specifies `fileType` is expected to be a string (e.g., 'pdf', 'csv', 'image').
    *   **`required: false`**: This parameter is optional. If not provided, the backend parsing service will attempt to auto-detect the file type.
    *   **`visibility: 'hidden'`**: This parameter is likely for internal use or advanced scenarios and won't be directly exposed to typical users.
    *   **`description: 'Type of file to parse (auto-detected if not specified)'`**: Explains its purpose.

##### **Request Configuration (`request`)**

```typescript
  request: {
    url: '/api/files/parse',
    method: 'POST',
    headers: () => ({
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    }),
    body: (params: any) => { /* ... logic ... */ },
  },
```

This object configures how the tool makes an HTTP request to the external file parsing service.

*   **`url: '/api/files/parse'`**: The endpoint URL on the application's backend API that handles file parsing.
*   **`method: 'POST'`**: The HTTP method used for the request, indicating that data will be sent to the server.
*   **`headers: () => ({ 'Content-Type': 'application/json' })`**: A function that returns an object of HTTP headers for the request. Here, it sets the `Content-Type` to `application/json`, indicating that the request body will be JSON formatted. This is a function (a "thunk") so headers can be determined at the time of the request if needed, though here it's static.

*   **`body: (params: any) => { ... }`**: This is a crucial function that generates the HTTP request body based on the `params` received by the tool. It's where the input parameters are transformed into the payload sent to the API.

    *   **`logger.info('Request parameters received by tool body:', params)`**: Logs the raw parameters received by the `body` function for debugging.
    *   **`if (!params) { ... }`**: Checks if any parameters were provided at all. If not, it logs an error and throws an `Error`, as parameters are essential.
    *   **`let determinedFilePath: string | string[] | null = null`**: Initializes a variable to hold the determined file path(s). It can be a single string, an array of strings, or `null` if not found.
    *   **`const determinedFileType: string | undefined = params.fileType`**: Extracts the optional `fileType` directly from the input parameters.

    *   **File Path Determination Logic (Simplified)**:
        This section is critical and slightly complex as it accounts for various ways `filePath` might be provided, prioritizing certain formats over others to ensure compatibility with different parts of the application or older systems. It's essentially a series of checks, trying to find the file path in a specific order:

        1.  **`if (params.filePath)`**: **Highest priority.** Checks if `filePath` is directly provided in the `params` object. This is the most straightforward and preferred way.
            *   `logger.info('Tool body found direct filePath:', params.filePath)`: Logs the found path.
            *   `determinedFilePath = params.filePath`: Assigns the directly provided path.
        2.  **`else if (params.file && Array.isArray(params.file) && params.file.length > 0)`**: **Second priority.** Checks if `params.file` is an array of file objects (e.g., from a multiple file upload UI), each with a `path` property.
            *   `logger.info('Tool body processing file array upload')`: Logs this path.
            *   `const filePaths = params.file.map((file: any) => file.path)`: Extracts all `path` properties into a new array.
            *   `determinedFilePath = filePaths`: Assigns the array of paths.
        3.  **`else if (params.file?.path)`**: **Third priority.** Checks if `params.file` is a single file object with a `path` property (e.g., from a single file upload UI). The `?.` (optional chaining) safely accesses `path` only if `params.file` exists.
            *   `logger.info('Tool body processing single file object upload')`: Logs this path.
            *   `determinedFilePath = params.file.path`: Assigns the single path.
        4.  **`else if (params.files && Array.isArray(params.files))`**: **Lowest priority (Legacy support).** Checks for a deprecated `params.files` array (plural) of file objects. This handles older input formats.
            *   `logger.info('Tool body processing legacy files array:', params.files.length)`: Logs the array length.
            *   `if (params.files.length > 0) { ... }`: If the legacy array has elements, extract their paths.
            *   `determinedFilePath = params.files.map((file: any) => file.path)`: Extracts paths.
            *   `else { logger.warn('Legacy files array provided but is empty') }`: Warns if the legacy array is empty.

    *   **`if (!determinedFilePath) { ... }`**: After all checks, if `determinedFilePath` is still `null`, it means no valid file path could be found.
        *   `logger.error(...)`: Logs an error.
        *   `throw new Error('Missing required parameter: filePath')`: Throws an error, indicating the tool cannot proceed.
    *   **`logger.info('Tool body determined filePath:', determinedFilePath)`**: Logs the final determined file path(s).
    *   **`return { filePath: determinedFilePath, fileType: determinedFileType }`**: Returns an object that will be serialized as the JSON request body, containing the determined `filePath` (or paths) and `fileType`.

##### **Response Transformation (`transformResponse`)**

```typescript
  transformResponse: async (response: Response): Promise<FileParserOutput> => {
    logger.info('Received response status:', response.status)

    const result = await response.json()
    logger.info('Response parsed successfully')

    // ... logic for handling single or multiple files ...
  },
```

This asynchronous function is responsible for taking the raw HTTP `response` from the `/api/files/parse` endpoint and transforming it into the structured `FileParserOutput` format that the rest of the application expects.

*   **`async (response: Response): Promise<FileParserOutput> => { ... }`**: Declares an asynchronous function named `transformResponse` that takes a standard `Response` object and returns a `Promise` that resolves to a `FileParserOutput`.
*   **`logger.info('Received response status:', response.status)`**: Logs the HTTP status code of the response.
*   **`const result = await response.json()`**: Parses the JSON body of the HTTP response. Since `response.json()` is asynchronous, `await` is used.
*   **`logger.info('Response parsed successfully')`**: Logs confirmation after successfully parsing the JSON.

    *   **Handling Multiple Files (Complex Logic Simplified)**:
        This block executes if the API response indicates that multiple files were processed (e.g., `result.results` exists). The goal is to combine their contents and make individual files easily accessible.

        ```typescript
        if (result.results) {
          logger.info('Processing multiple files response')

          const fileResults = result.results.map((fileResult: any) => {
            return fileResult.output || fileResult
          })

          const combinedContent = fileResults
            .map((file: FileParseResult, index: number) => {
              const divider = `\n${'='.repeat(80)}\n`
              return file.content + (index < fileResults.length - 1 ? divider : '')
            })
            .join('\n')

          const output: FileParserOutputData = {
            files: fileResults,
            combinedContent,
          }

          fileResults.forEach((file: FileParseResult, index: number) => {
            output[`file${index + 1}`] = file
          })

          return {
            success: true,
            output,
          }
        }
        ```

        *   **`if (result.results)`**: Checks if the response JSON has a `results` property, which typically indicates an array of results from multiple files.
        *   **`const fileResults = result.results.map(...)`**: Iterates over the `results` array. For each `fileResult`, it tries to use `fileResult.output` (if it exists, meaning the API wraps the actual file data) or falls back to `fileResult` itself. This standardizes the individual file result objects.
        *   **`const combinedContent = fileResults.map(...).join('\n')`**: This block generates a single string containing the content of all parsed files, separated by a visual divider (80 equals signs).
            *   `map` iterates through each `file` in `fileResults`.
            *   For each file, it takes its `content`.
            *   `const divider = ...`: Defines the divider string.
            *   `+ (index < fileResults.length - 1 ? divider : '')`: Appends the divider *after* each file's content, except for the last one, to avoid a trailing divider.
            *   `.join('\n')`: Combines all these modified content strings into one large string, with an extra newline between each one for good measure.
        *   **`const output: FileParserOutputData = { ... }`**: Creates the base `output` object adhering to `FileParserOutputData`.
            *   `files: fileResults`: An array containing all individual `FileParseResult` objects.
            *   `combinedContent`: The single string with all file contents.
        *   **`fileResults.forEach((file: FileParseResult, index: number) => { output[`file${index + 1}`] = file })`**: This loop dynamically adds properties like `file1`, `file2`, etc., to the `output` object. This allows other parts of the application to access specific parsed files directly by name (e.g., `output.file1`) in addition to accessing them via the `files` array.
        *   **`return { success: true, output }`**: Returns the final `FileParserOutput` object, indicating success and providing the structured output data.

    *   **Handling Single File (Simplified Logic)**:
        This block executes if `result.results` was not present, meaning the API returned a single file parsing result.

        ```typescript
        // Handle single file response
        logger.info('Successfully parsed file:', result.output?.name || 'unknown')

        const output: FileParserOutputData = {
          files: [result.output || result],
          combinedContent: result.output?.content || result.content || '',
          file1: result.output || result,
        }

        return {
          success: true,
          output,
        }
        ```

        *   **`logger.info(...)`**: Logs the name of the successfully parsed file.
        *   **`const output: FileParserOutputData = { ... }`**: Creates the `output` object for a single file.
            *   `files: [result.output || result]`: Even for a single file, it's wrapped in an array to maintain consistency with the `files` property in the multiple-file scenario. It checks for `result.output` first, then falls back to `result`.
            *   `combinedContent: result.output?.content || result.content || ''`: Extracts the content from the single parsed file, again checking for `result.output.content` first, then `result.content`, and defaulting to an empty string.
            *   `file1: result.output || result`: Adds a named property `file1` for direct access to the single file result, again ensuring consistency.
        *   **`return { success: true, output }`**: Returns the `FileParserOutput` object, indicating success and providing the structured output data.

##### **Outputs (`outputs`)**

```typescript
  outputs: {
    files: { type: 'array', description: 'Array of parsed files' },
    combinedContent: { type: 'string', description: 'Combined content of all parsed files' },
  },
```

This object declares the shape of the data that the tool will produce after its `transformResponse` function has executed. This is useful for other parts of the application (e.g., UI, other tools) to understand what kind of data they can expect to receive.

*   **`files: { type: 'array', description: 'Array of parsed files' }`**: Declares that an output property named `files` will be an array, containing the individual parsed file results.
*   **`combinedContent: { type: 'string', description: 'Combined content of all parsed files' }`**: Declares that an output property named `combinedContent` will be a string, holding the concatenated content of all parsed files.

---

### **Summary of Complex Logic**

1.  **`request.body` (File Path Determination):** The most complex part here is the multiple `if/else if` chain. This isn't just arbitrary; it's a robust mechanism to handle various ways a file (or files) might be provided as input to the tool. It prioritizes direct `filePath` input but also supports common upload patterns (single file object, array of file objects) and even legacy input formats. This makes the tool highly adaptable to different calling contexts within the application.

2.  **`transformResponse` (Output Structuring):** This function cleverly handles both single and multiple file responses from the backend API.
    *   **Normalization:** It first normalizes the individual file result objects (`fileResult.output || fileResult`) to ensure a consistent structure.
    *   **`combinedContent`:** It generates a user-friendly `combinedContent` string, which is often what downstream consumers need most, especially when dealing with multiple text documents.
    *   **Dual Access (Array and Named Properties):** For flexibility, it provides the parsed files in two ways:
        *   As an array (`output.files`), which is good for programmatic iteration.
        *   As dynamically named properties (`output.file1`, `output.file2`, etc.), which can be convenient for direct access or for UI components that might present dropdowns for each file. This ensures that regardless of whether one or many files were parsed, the output is consistently structured and easy to consume.

This `fileParserTool` provides a comprehensive and flexible solution for integrating file parsing capabilities into the application, designed to be resilient to varied inputs and provide a rich, structured output.
