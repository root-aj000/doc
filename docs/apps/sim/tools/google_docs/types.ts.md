This TypeScript file acts as a **blueprint for interacting with Google Docs** through a specialized "tool" or API. It defines the exact structure (or "shape") of the data that's used when you send commands to Google Docs (like reading, writing, or creating a document) and when you receive responses back.

Think of it like this: if you're ordering food, this file specifies the menu (what you can order, e.g., `GoogleDocsToolParams`) and the different types of receipts you might get back (e.g., `GoogleDocsReadResponse`, `GoogleDocsWriteResponse`). This ensures that everyone—the part of the system making the request and the part receiving the response—agrees on how the information should look.

### Simplifying Complex Logic

The core idea here is **type safety** and **clarity**.

*   **Interfaces (`interface`)**: These are like contracts. They define the names and types of properties an object *must* have. For example, `GoogleDocsMetadata` ensures that any object described as document metadata will always have a `documentId` and `title`.
*   **Type Aliases (`type`)**: These create new names for existing types. `GoogleDocsResponse` uses a "union type" (`|`), which means an object of this type can be *one of several* specific structures. This is powerful because a single function can return different response types depending on the action it performed (read, write, or create).
*   **Extending Interfaces (`extends`)**: This allows an interface to inherit properties from another interface. For example, `GoogleDocsReadResponse extends ToolResponse` means that `GoogleDocsReadResponse` will have all the properties of `ToolResponse` *plus* its own specific properties for reading a document. This promotes code reuse and consistency.

### Detailed Explanation

Let's break down each part of the code:

#### 1. Import Statement

```typescript
import type { ToolResponse } from '@/tools/types'
```

*   **`import type { ToolResponse } from '@/tools/types'`**: This line brings in a definition from another file.
    *   `import type`: This is a TypeScript-specific import that only imports type definitions, not actual executable code. This is a performance optimization and helps prevent circular dependencies in some build setups.
    *   `{ ToolResponse }`: This specifies that we are importing an interface (or type) named `ToolResponse`.
    *   `from '@/tools/types'`: This indicates the path to the file where `ToolResponse` is defined. The `@/` prefix suggests an alias for a common source directory in the project (e.g., `src/`).
    *   **Purpose**: `ToolResponse` likely provides a common base structure for *any* response from *any* tool in the system, ensuring consistency (e.g., it might include `success: boolean`, `message?: string`, `error?: any`). All Google Docs-specific responses will extend this base.

#### 2. GoogleDocsMetadata Interface

```typescript
export interface GoogleDocsMetadata {
  documentId: string
  title: string
  mimeType?: string
  createdTime?: string
  modifiedTime?: string
  url?: string
}
```

*   **`export interface GoogleDocsMetadata`**: Defines a new interface named `GoogleDocsMetadata` and makes it available for use in other files (`export`). This interface describes the essential information about a Google Doc.
    *   `documentId: string`: The unique identifier for the Google Doc. This is a mandatory (`:` instead of `?:`) string.
    *   `title: string`: The human-readable title of the document. Also mandatory.
    *   `mimeType?: string`: An optional (`?`) string representing the document's MIME type (e.g., `'application/vnd.google-apps.document'` for a Google Doc, `'application/vnd.google-apps.spreadsheet'` for a Sheet).
    *   `createdTime?: string`: An optional string representing the timestamp when the document was created.
    *   `modifiedTime?: string`: An optional string representing the timestamp when the document was last modified.
    *   `url?: string`: An optional string representing the URL to access the document.
    *   **Purpose**: To precisely define the structure of metadata associated with a Google Docs file, ensuring that all parts of the application handle this information consistently.

#### 3. GoogleDocsReadResponse Interface

```typescript
export interface GoogleDocsReadResponse extends ToolResponse {
  output: {
    content: string
    metadata: GoogleDocsMetadata
  }
}
```

*   **`export interface GoogleDocsReadResponse extends ToolResponse`**: Defines an interface for the response received after *reading* a Google Doc. It `extends ToolResponse`, meaning it inherits all properties from the `ToolResponse` interface (like `success`, `error`, etc.) in addition to its own.
    *   `output: { ... }`: This mandatory property contains the specific data returned by the read operation.
        *   `content: string`: The actual text content retrieved from the Google Doc. This is a mandatory string.
        *   `metadata: GoogleDocsMetadata`: A mandatory object that conforms to the `GoogleDocsMetadata` interface, providing details about the document that was read.
    *   **Purpose**: To define the expected structure of a successful response when an application attempts to *read* the content of a Google Doc.

#### 4. GoogleDocsWriteResponse Interface

```typescript
export interface GoogleDocsWriteResponse extends ToolResponse {
  output: {
    updatedContent: boolean
    metadata: GoogleDocsMetadata
  }
}
```

*   **`export interface GoogleDocsWriteResponse extends ToolResponse`**: Defines an interface for the response received after *writing* or *updating* a Google Doc. It also `extends ToolResponse`.
    *   `output: { ... }`: This mandatory property contains the specific data returned by the write operation.
        *   `updatedContent: boolean`: A boolean value indicating whether the document's content was successfully updated (`true`) or if no changes were made (`false`).
        *   `metadata: GoogleDocsMetadata`: A mandatory object providing the updated metadata of the document after the write operation.
    *   **Purpose**: To define the expected structure of a successful response when an application attempts to *write* or *update* the content of a Google Doc.

#### 5. GoogleDocsCreateResponse Interface

```typescript
export interface GoogleDocsCreateResponse extends ToolResponse {
  output: {
    metadata: GoogleDocsMetadata
  }
}
```

*   **`export interface GoogleDocsCreateResponse extends ToolResponse`**: Defines an interface for the response received after *creating* a new Google Doc. It also `extends ToolResponse`.
    *   `output: { ... }`: This mandatory property contains the specific data returned by the create operation.
        *   `metadata: GoogleDocsMetadata`: A mandatory object providing the metadata of the *newly created* document. Since it's a new document, `content` isn't returned here, as it would likely be empty or minimal.
    *   **Purpose**: To define the expected structure of a successful response when an application attempts to *create* a new Google Doc.

#### 6. GoogleDocsToolParams Interface

```typescript
export interface GoogleDocsToolParams {
  accessToken: string
  documentId?: string
  manualDocumentId?: string
  title?: string
  content?: string
  folderId?: string
  folderSelector?: string
}
```

*   **`export interface GoogleDocsToolParams`**: Defines the parameters (inputs) required when making a request to the Google Docs tool.
    *   `accessToken: string`: A mandatory string, likely an OAuth 2.0 access token, used to authenticate the request with Google Docs API.
    *   `documentId?: string`: An optional string that uniquely identifies an existing Google Doc. Used when reading or updating.
    *   `manualDocumentId?: string`: An alternative or supplementary optional string for identifying a document. This might be used in cases where `documentId` comes from an automated process, and `manualDocumentId` allows for user override or specific manual input.
    *   `title?: string`: An optional string representing the title for a new document (when creating) or an updated title for an existing one.
    *   `content?: string`: An optional string representing the content to be written into a document (when writing or creating).
    *   `folderId?: string`: An optional string representing the unique identifier of a Google Drive folder where a new document should be created.
    *   `folderSelector?: string`: An optional string that might represent a user-friendly way to select a folder, perhaps by name or path, which would then be resolved to a `folderId` internally.
    *   **Purpose**: To ensure that all requests sent to the Google Docs tool provide the necessary information in a consistent format, whether it's for reading, writing, or creating a document.

#### 7. GoogleDocsResponse Type Alias

```typescript
export type GoogleDocsResponse =
  | GoogleDocsReadResponse
  | GoogleDocsWriteResponse
  | GoogleDocsCreateResponse
```

*   **`export type GoogleDocsResponse`**: This line defines a **union type** named `GoogleDocsResponse`.
    *   `|`: The pipe symbol `|` signifies a union. It means that a variable or function return type of `GoogleDocsResponse` can be *any one* of the types listed.
    *   `GoogleDocsReadResponse | GoogleDocsWriteResponse | GoogleDocsCreateResponse`: This means a `GoogleDocsResponse` object could be structured like a `GoogleDocsReadResponse`, OR a `GoogleDocsWriteResponse`, OR a `GoogleDocsCreateResponse`.
    *   **Purpose**: This is incredibly useful for functions that perform different Google Docs operations (read, write, create) and might return different data structures depending on what they did. This type allows TypeScript to understand all possible return shapes, enabling robust type checking and auto-completion when handling the responses.

### Conclusion

This file is a foundational part of any TypeScript application that needs to programmatically interact with Google Docs. By clearly defining the expected shapes of inputs and outputs, it brings several benefits:

1.  **Readability and Maintainability**: It's easy for developers to understand what data is involved in Google Docs operations.
2.  **Type Safety**: TypeScript can catch errors *before* the code even runs, ensuring that data is always handled in the correct format.
3.  **Developer Experience**: Tools like IDEs can provide intelligent auto-completion and helpful error messages based on these definitions.
4.  **API Contract**: It serves as a clear contract between the application code and the underlying Google Docs API wrapper.
