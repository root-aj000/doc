## Explanation: Google Docs Create Tool Configuration

This TypeScript file defines a sophisticated configuration object for a "tool" designed to create new Google Docs documents programmatically. This `createTool` object acts as a blueprint, instructing a larger system on how to interact with the Google Drive API to perform this specific action.

Essentially, it's a declarative way to describe:
1.  **What the tool does.**
2.  **What inputs it requires.**
3.  **How to authenticate.**
4.  **How to make the necessary API request.**
5.  **How to handle the API response.**
6.  **How to perform follow-up actions (like adding initial content).**

### Purpose of This File

The primary purpose of this file is to define a reusable and standardized "tool" called `google_docs_create`. This tool allows other parts of an application (e.g., an AI agent, a backend service, or a UI component) to initiate the creation of a Google Docs document without needing to know the low-level details of the Google Drive API. It encapsulates all the necessary logic for authentication, request construction, response parsing, and even an optional post-creation content insertion step.

### Simplified Complex Logic

The most "complex" piece of logic here is found in the `postProcess` function. Let's simplify it:

*   **The Problem:** When you create a Google Docs document via the Google Drive API, it's initially an *empty* document. If you want to add content to it right away, you need to make a *separate* API call to the Google Docs API (not the Google Drive API).
*   **The Solution (`postProcess`):** This function acts as a "follow-up task manager."
    1.  After the initial Google Drive API call successfully creates the empty document, `postProcess` gets triggered.
    2.  It extracts the ID of the newly created (empty) document.
    3.  If the user provided `content` in the original request, `postProcess` then *calls another internal tool* (likely named `google_docs_write`) to write that content into the document using its ID.
    4.  It handles potential failures of this content-writing step gracefully, logging a warning but not failing the overall document creation process. This means the document is still created even if the content couldn't be added for some reason.

This chaining of tools (`create` -> `write`) is a powerful pattern for building complex workflows out of smaller, well-defined operations.

### Line-by-Line Explanation

```typescript
import { createLogger } from '@/lib/logs/console/logger'
import type { GoogleDocsCreateResponse, GoogleDocsToolParams } from '@/tools/google_docs/types'
import type { ToolConfig } from '@/tools/types'
```

*   **`import { createLogger } from '@/lib/logs/console/logger'`**: Imports a function `createLogger` from a specific path. This function is used to create a logging instance for debugging and operational insights, often configured to output to the console or other log aggregators. The `@/` prefix typically indicates a path alias configured in the project's `tsconfig.json` or module bundler.
*   **`import type { GoogleDocsCreateResponse, GoogleDocsToolParams } from '@/tools/google_docs/types'`**: Imports TypeScript `type` definitions.
    *   `GoogleDocsCreateResponse`: Defines the expected structure of the successful output when this tool is executed.
    *   `GoogleDocsToolParams`: Defines the expected structure of the input parameters required by this tool.
    *   These types ensure strong type-checking and provide documentation for how to interact with this tool.
*   **`import type { ToolConfig } from '@/tools/types'`**: Imports the generic `ToolConfig` type. This type likely provides the overall structure that all tools in the system must adhere to, enforcing consistency across different integrations.

```typescript
const logger = createLogger('GoogleDocsCreateTool')
```

*   **`const logger = createLogger('GoogleDocsCreateTool')`**: Creates a logger instance specifically for this `GoogleDocsCreateTool`. When messages are logged using this `logger` (e.g., `logger.warn`), they will be prefixed or tagged with `'GoogleDocsCreateTool'`, making it easier to trace messages related to this specific component in the logs.

```typescript
export const createTool: ToolConfig<GoogleDocsToolParams, GoogleDocsCreateResponse> = {
  // ... tool configuration ...
}
```

*   **`export const createTool:`**: Declares and exports a constant variable named `createTool`. The `export` keyword makes this configuration object available for other files to import and use.
*   **`ToolConfig<GoogleDocsToolParams, GoogleDocsCreateResponse>`**: This is a TypeScript generic type annotation. It specifies that `createTool` must conform to the `ToolConfig` interface, and it uses `GoogleDocsToolParams` as its input parameter type and `GoogleDocsCreateResponse` as its output response type. This enforces type safety throughout the configuration.
*   **`= { ... }`**: This is the object literal defining the tool's configuration.

#### Basic Tool Metadata

```typescript
  id: 'google_docs_create',
  name: 'Create Google Docs Document',
  description: 'Create a new Google Docs document',
  version: '1.0',
```

*   **`id: 'google_docs_create'`**: A unique identifier for this tool within the system. Used for programmatic lookup and execution (e.g., `executeTool('google_docs_create', ...) `).
*   **`name: 'Create Google Docs Document'`**: A human-readable name for the tool, often used in UIs or descriptive outputs.
*   **`description: 'Create a new Google Docs document'`**: A longer description explaining what the tool does, useful for documentation or user interfaces.
*   **`version: '1.0'`**: The version number of this tool configuration. Useful for managing updates and compatibility.

---

#### OAuth Configuration

```typescript
  oauth: {
    required: true,
    provider: 'google-docs',
    additionalScopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file'],
  },
```

*   **`oauth: { ... }`**: This block specifies the OAuth (Open Authorization) requirements for using this tool. OAuth is a standard for delegated authorization, allowing users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other sites without giving them their password.
*   **`required: true`**: Indicates that authentication is absolutely necessary to use this tool.
*   **`provider: 'google-docs'`**: Specifies which OAuth provider to use. The system likely has a mechanism to look up authentication details for 'google-docs'.
*   **`additionalScopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file']`**: An array of OAuth scopes required. A "scope" defines the level of access an application has to a user's data.
    *   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`: This specific scope grants permission to create and modify files in Google Drive that are created by the application itself. It's a restricted scope, meaning the app only sees files it creates, not *all* files in the user's Drive.

#### Parameters Definition

```typescript
  params: {
    accessToken: {
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
      visibility: 'hidden',
      description: 'The access token for the Google Docs API',
    },
    title: {
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
      visibility: 'user-or-llm',
      description: 'The title of the document to create',
    },
    content: {
      type: 'string',
      required: false,
      visibility: 'user-or-llm',
      description: 'The content of the document to create',
    },

      type: 'string',
      required: false,
      visibility: 'user-only',
      description: 'Select the folder to create the document in',
    },
    folderId: {
      type: 'string',
      required: false,
      visibility: 'hidden',
      description: 'The ID of the folder to create the document in (internal use)',
    },
  },
```

*   **`params: { ... }`**: This object defines all the input parameters that the `createTool` expects. Each property within `params` describes a single input.
    *   **`accessToken`**:
        *   `type: 'string'`: It's a text string.
        *   `required: true`: This parameter *must* be provided.
        *   `visibility: 'hidden'`: This parameter should not be exposed to the end-user or directly prompted from an LLM (Large Language Model); it's expected to be managed internally by the system.
        *   `description: 'The access token for the Google Docs API'`: Explains its purpose.
    *   **`title`**:
        *   `type: 'string'`, `required: true`: The document title is a mandatory string.
        *   `visibility: 'user-or-llm'`: Can be provided either by a human user or generated by an LLM.
        *   `description: 'The title of the document to create'`: Self-explanatory.
    *   **`content`**:
        *   `type: 'string'`, `required: false`: Optional string content to pre-fill the document.
        *   `visibility: 'user-or-llm'`: Can be provided by a user or an LLM.
        *   `description: 'The content of the document to create'`: Explains its purpose.
    *   **`folderSelector`**:
        *   `type: 'string'`, `required: false`: An optional string that might represent a user-friendly way to select a folder (e.g., a path or a name).
        *   `visibility: 'user-only'`: Only intended for human users to provide, not expected from an LLM.
        *   `description: 'Select the folder to create the document in'`: Explains its purpose.
    *   **`folderId`**:
        *   `type: 'string'`, `required: false`: An optional string representing the actual Google Drive folder ID.
        *   `visibility: 'hidden'`: Intended for internal system use, not user/LLM facing.
        *   `description: 'The ID of the folder to create the document in (internal use)'`: Explains its purpose.

#### Request Configuration

```typescript
  request: {
    url: () => {
      return 'https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/files'
    },
    method: 'POST',
    headers: (params) => {
      // Validate access token
      if (!params.accessToken) {
        throw new Error('Access token is required')
      }

      return {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${params.accessToken}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      }
    },
    body: (params) => {
      if (!params.title) {
        throw new Error('Title is required')
      }

      const requestBody: any = {
        name: params.title,
        mimeType: 'application/vnd.google-apps.document',
      }

      // Add parent folder if specified (prefer folderSelector over folderId)
      const folderId = params.folderSelector || params.folderId
      if (folderId) {
        requestBody.parents = [folderId]
      }

      return requestBody
    },
  },
```

*   **`request: { ... }`**: This object defines how the HTTP request to the external API should be constructed.
    *   **`url: () => { return 'https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/files' }`**: A function that returns the API endpoint URL. In this case, it's the Google Drive API endpoint for working with files (creating, listing, etc.).
    *   **`method: 'POST'`**: Specifies that an HTTP POST request should be made, which is typically used for creating new resources.
    *   **`headers: (params) => { ... }`**: A function that takes the tool's input parameters (`params`) and returns an object of HTTP headers.
        *   **`if (!params.accessToken) { throw new Error('Access token is required') }`**: Basic validation to ensure the `accessToken` is present before attempting to construct headers.
        *   **`Authorization: `Bearer ${params.accessToken}``**: The standard way to send an OAuth 2.0 access token in the `Authorization` header. This token authenticates the request to Google's servers.
        *   **`'Content-Type': 'application/json'`**: Indicates that the request body will be in JSON format.
    *   **`body: (params) => { ... }`**: A function that takes the tool's input parameters (`params`) and returns the HTTP request body (which will be JSON due to `Content-Type`).
        *   **`if (!params.title) { throw new Error('Title is required') }`**: Validation to ensure the document `title` is provided.
        *   **`const requestBody: any = { ... }`**: Initializes an object that will become the JSON request body.
            *   **`name: params.title`**: Sets the `name` property of the new file to the provided `title`.
            *   **`mimeType: 'application/vnd.google-apps.document'`**: This is crucial. It tells Google Drive that the file being created should be a Google Docs document (not a generic file, a Sheet, or a Slide).
        *   **`const folderId = params.folderSelector || params.folderId`**: This line implements a preference: if `params.folderSelector` (the user-friendly input) is provided, use that; otherwise, fall back to `params.folderId` (the internal ID).
        *   **`if (folderId) { requestBody.parents = [folderId] }`**: If a `folderId` was determined, it's added to the `requestBody` under the `parents` property. The `parents` property in Google Drive API is an array, allowing a file to potentially exist in multiple folders, though typically it's one.
        *   **`return requestBody`**: Returns the constructed object to be sent as the request body.

#### Post-Processing Logic

```typescript
  postProcess: async (result, params, executeTool) => {
    if (!result.success) {
      return result
    }

    const documentId = result.output.metadata.documentId

    if (params.content && documentId) {
      try {
        const writeParams = {
          accessToken: params.accessToken,
          documentId: documentId,
          content: params.content,
        }

        const writeResult = await executeTool('google_docs_write', writeParams)

        if (!writeResult.success) {
          logger.warn(
            'Failed to add content to document, but document was created:',
            writeResult.error
          )
        }
      } catch (error) {
        logger.warn('Error adding content to document:', { error })
        // Don't fail the overall operation if adding content fails
      }
    }

    return result
  },
```

*   **`postProcess: async (result, params, executeTool) => { ... }`**: An asynchronous function that executes *after* the initial HTTP request (`request` block) has received a response and that response has been transformed (`transformResponse` block).
    *   `result`: The processed output from the initial API call (creating the empty document).
    *   `params`: The original input parameters provided to this `createTool`.
    *   `executeTool`: A function provided by the system to call *other* tools internally, enabling tool chaining.
*   **`if (!result.success) { return result }`**: If the initial document creation failed (e.g., due to an API error), there's no point in trying to add content, so return the failed `result` immediately.
*   **`const documentId = result.output.metadata.documentId`**: Extracts the ID of the newly created Google Docs document from the `result` of the initial creation step.
*   **`if (params.content && documentId) { ... }`**: Checks if the user provided initial `content` and if a `documentId` was successfully obtained. If both are true, proceed to add content.
*   **`try { ... } catch (error) { ... }`**: A `try...catch` block for robust error handling during the content addition step.
    *   **`const writeParams = { ... }`**: Creates an object with parameters needed for the `google_docs_write` tool. It reuses the `accessToken`, passes the `documentId`, and includes the `content`.
    *   **`const writeResult = await executeTool('google_docs_write', writeParams)`**: This is the key "tool chaining" step. It calls another tool (`google_docs_write`) and awaits its completion. This `google_docs_write` tool would be responsible for making the actual Google Docs API call to insert content into the document.
    *   **`if (!writeResult.success) { logger.warn(...) }`**: If the `google_docs_write` tool fails, a warning is logged. The message indicates that the document was created successfully, but content addition failed. This is an important design choice: the creation is successful even if the content cannot be added, preventing a total failure.
    *   **`catch (error) { logger.warn('Error adding content to document:', { error }) }`**: Catches any unexpected errors during the `executeTool` call itself, logging a warning.
    *   **`// Don't fail the overall operation if adding content fails`**: A comment explicitly stating the design decision to prioritize document creation over content insertion in case of a partial failure.
*   **`return result`**: Regardless of whether content was added successfully or not (only if the initial document creation was successful), the original `result` of the document creation is returned.

#### Response Transformation

```typescript
  transformResponse: async (response: Response) => {
    try {
      // Get the response data
      const responseText = await response.text()
      const data = JSON.parse(responseText)

      const documentId = data.id
      const title = data.name

      const metadata = {
        documentId,
        title: title || 'Untitled Document',
        mimeType: 'application/vnd.google-apps.document',
        url: `https://docs.google.com/document/d/${documentId}/edit`,
      }

      return {
        success: true,
        output: {
          metadata,
        },
      }
    } catch (error) {
      logger.error('Google Docs create - Error processing response:', {
        error,
      })
      throw error
    }
  },
```

*   **`transformResponse: async (response: Response) => { ... }`**: An asynchronous function responsible for taking the raw HTTP `Response` object from the Google Drive API and transforming it into a structured, standardized output for the `createTool`.
*   **`try { ... } catch (error) { ... }`**: A `try...catch` block to handle potential errors during response parsing (e.g., if the API returns malformed JSON).
    *   **`const responseText = await response.text()`**: Reads the entire body of the HTTP response as a string.
    *   **`const data = JSON.parse(responseText)`**: Parses the JSON string into a JavaScript object. This `data` object now contains the information returned by the Google Drive API about the newly created file.
    *   **`const documentId = data.id`**: Extracts the `id` property from the API response data, which is the unique ID of the created document.
    *   **`const title = data.name`**: Extracts the `name` property, which is the title of the created document.
    *   **`const metadata = { ... }`**: Creates an object containing key metadata about the newly created document.
        *   **`documentId`**: The ID of the document.
        *   **`title: title || 'Untitled Document'`**: The document's title, with a fallback to 'Untitled Document' if `data.name` was unexpectedly empty.
        *   **`mimeType: 'application/vnd.google-apps.document'`**: Confirms the MIME type.
        *   **`url: `https://docs.google.com/document/d/${documentId}/edit``**: Constructs the direct URL to open and edit the newly created Google Docs document.
    *   **`return { success: true, output: { metadata, }, }`**: Returns the standardized success response.
        *   `success: true`: Indicates the tool execution was successful.
        *   `output: { metadata }`: Contains the actual output data, structured with the `metadata` object.
*   **`catch (error) { logger.error(...) ; throw error }`**: If an error occurs during parsing or transformation (e.g., invalid JSON), it logs the error and then re-throws it. This signals a critical failure in processing the API response.

---

#### Outputs Definition

```typescript
  outputs: {
    metadata: {
      type: 'json',
      description: 'Created document metadata including ID, title, and URL',
    },
  },
}
```

*   **`outputs: { ... }`**: This object declaratively describes the structure and types of the output that this tool will produce upon successful execution. This is valuable for documentation, schema generation, and for other parts of the system that consume this tool's output.
    *   **`metadata: { ... }`**: Describes the `metadata` property within the output.
        *   **`type: 'json'`**: Indicates that `metadata` itself is a JSON object.
        *   **`description: 'Created document metadata including ID, title, and URL'`**: A descriptive string explaining what the `metadata` object contains.

---

### Key Takeaways

*   **Declarative Configuration**: The entire tool is defined as a static object, making it easy to understand, manage, and extend.
*   **Modularity**: This `createTool` focuses specifically on *creating* a document. The task of *writing content* is delegated to another tool (`google_docs_write`), demonstrating good separation of concerns.
*   **Robustness**: Error handling in `postProcess` and `transformResponse` ensures that the tool behaves gracefully even when parts of the operation fail or unexpected responses are received.
*   **Type Safety**: The use of `ToolConfig` and specific input/output types (`GoogleDocsToolParams`, `GoogleDocsCreateResponse`) provides strong type-checking, reducing bugs and improving developer experience.
*   **Clear Intent**: Properties like `visibility` in `params` help guide how different input sources (users, LLMs, internal system) should interact with the tool.
