This TypeScript file acts as a utility module for constructing URLs that interact with the Google Forms API. Its primary purpose is to simplify the process of generating correctly formatted API endpoints for fetching response data from Google Forms, handling details like URL encoding and query parameters.

Let's break down the code step by step.

---

### **Purpose of this File**

This `GoogleFormsUtils.ts` file is designed to be a convenient helper for any application that needs to retrieve form responses from Google Forms. Instead of manually constructing complex API URLs every time, you can use the functions provided here to generate them reliably. It specifically focuses on two common operations:

1.  **Listing all responses for a form.**
2.  **Retrieving a single, specific response for a form.**

It also incorporates logging for easier debugging and ensures best practices like URL encoding and handling API-specific limits (like `pageSize`).

---

### **Simplified Complex Logic: The `pageSize` Limit**

The most "complex" piece of logic here is found within the `buildListResponsesUrl` function, specifically how it handles the `pageSize` parameter.

**Original Logic:**
```typescript
if (pageSize && pageSize > 0) {
  const limited = Math.min(pageSize, 5000)
  url.searchParams.set('pageSize', String(limited))
}
```

**Simplified Explanation:**

When you ask the Google Forms API to list responses, you can tell it how many responses you want per page using a `pageSize` parameter. However, Google's API has a maximum limit for this â€“ you can't request more than `5000` responses in a single go.

This code snippet makes sure that your request *never exceeds this limit*.

*   It first checks if you've provided a `pageSize` at all and if it's a positive number.
*   Then, `Math.min(pageSize, 5000)` calculates the *smaller* of two values:
    *   The `pageSize` you requested.
    *   The maximum allowed `5000`.
*   This `limited` value is then used as the actual `pageSize` in the URL. So, if you ask for `10000`, it will actually use `5000`. If you ask for `100`, it will use `100`. This prevents errors from the Google Forms API and ensures your requests are valid.

### **Line-by-Line Explanation**

```typescript
import { createLogger } from '@/lib/logs/console/logger'
```
*   **`import { createLogger } from '@/lib/logs/console/logger'`**: This line imports a function named `createLogger` from a specific path within your project (`@/lib/logs/console/logger`). This suggests your application uses a custom logging utility to output messages to the console or other logging destinations. It's a common practice to centralize logging for consistency and better debugging.

```typescript
export const FORMS_API_BASE = 'https://forms.googleapis.com/v1'
```
*   **`export const FORMS_API_BASE = 'https://forms.googleapis.com/v1'`**: This declares a constant variable named `FORMS_API_BASE`.
    *   **`export`**: Makes this constant available for other files in your project to import and use.
    *   **`const`**: Ensures that the value of this variable cannot be reassigned after its initial declaration. It's a constant.
    *   Its value is the base URL for version 1 of the Google Forms API. This is a good practice to centralize API endpoints, making them easy to update if the API version or domain changes.

```typescript
const logger = createLogger('GoogleFormsUtils')
```
*   **`const logger = createLogger('GoogleFormsUtils')`**: This line initializes a logger instance specifically for this file.
    *   It calls the `createLogger` function (imported earlier) and passes the string `'GoogleFormsUtils'`.
    *   This string acts as a "context" or "name" for the logger, which means any log messages produced by this `logger` instance will likely include `[GoogleFormsUtils]` in their output. This helps developers identify which part of the application is generating specific log messages.

#### **`buildListResponsesUrl` Function**

This function constructs the URL required to fetch a list of all responses for a given Google Form.

```typescript
export function buildListResponsesUrl(params: { formId: string; pageSize?: number }): string {
```
*   **`export function buildListResponsesUrl(...)`**: Declares a function named `buildListResponsesUrl`.
    *   **`export`**: Makes this function available for other files to import and use.
    *   **`params: { formId: string; pageSize?: number }`**: Defines the function's input parameters.
        *   `formId: string`: A required parameter, representing the unique identifier of the Google Form. It must be a string.
        *   `pageSize?: number`: An optional parameter (indicated by `?`), representing the desired number of responses per page. If provided, it must be a number.
    *   **`: string`**: Specifies that the function will return a string, which will be the complete API URL.

```typescript
  const { formId, pageSize } = params
```
*   **`const { formId, pageSize } = params`**: This uses JavaScript's object destructuring syntax. It extracts the `formId` and `pageSize` properties directly from the `params` object into separate constant variables. This makes the code cleaner and easier to read, as you can now refer to `formId` and `pageSize` directly instead of `params.formId` and `params.pageSize`.

```typescript
  const url = new URL(`${FORMS_API_BASE}/forms/${encodeURIComponent(formId)}/responses`)
```
*   **`const url = new URL(...)`**: This creates a new `URL` object. The `URL` API is a powerful built-in JavaScript feature for working with URLs.
    *   **`` `${FORMS_API_BASE}/forms/${encodeURIComponent(formId)}/responses` ``**: This is a template literal that constructs the initial part of the URL string.
        *   `FORMS_API_BASE`: The base API URL defined earlier (`https://forms.googleapis.com/v1`).
        *   `/forms/`: A static path segment.
        *   **`encodeURIComponent(formId)`**: This is crucial for security and correctness. The `formId` could contain characters that are not valid in a URL path (e.g., spaces, slashes, special symbols). `encodeURIComponent` converts these characters into a URL-safe format (e.g., a space becomes `%20`). This prevents malformed URLs and potential security vulnerabilities (like path traversal).
        *   `/responses`: Another static path segment indicating that we are requesting a list of responses.

```typescript
  if (pageSize && pageSize > 0) {
```
*   **`if (pageSize && pageSize > 0)`**: This condition checks two things:
    *   `pageSize`: Checks if the `pageSize` variable has a truthy value (i.e., it's not `undefined` or `null`).
    *   `pageSize > 0`: Checks if the provided `pageSize` is a positive number. This ensures we only add `pageSize` to the URL if it's explicitly provided and meaningful.

```typescript
    const limited = Math.min(pageSize, 5000)
```
*   **`const limited = Math.min(pageSize, 5000)`**: This is the core of the `pageSize` limit logic (explained in the "Simplified Complex Logic" section above). It ensures the requested `pageSize` does not exceed `5000`, which is the maximum allowed by the Google Forms API.

```typescript
    url.searchParams.set('pageSize', String(limited))
```
*   **`url.searchParams.set('pageSize', String(limited))`**: This uses the `URL` object's `searchParams` property to add or update a query parameter.
    *   `url.searchParams`: An interface (`URLSearchParams`) for easily manipulating the query string part of a URL.
    *   `set('pageSize', ...)`: This method sets the value of the query parameter named `pageSize`. If `pageSize` already exists, its value is updated; otherwise, it's added.
    *   `String(limited)`: Query parameter values must be strings, so `limited` (which is a number) is explicitly converted to a string.

```typescript
  const finalUrl = url.toString()
```
*   **`const finalUrl = url.toString()`**: After all modifications (like adding `pageSize`), the `URL` object is converted back into its complete string representation. This `finalUrl` now contains the base path and any query parameters.

```typescript
  logger.debug('Built Google Forms list responses URL', { finalUrl })
```
*   **`logger.debug(...)`**: This line uses the `logger` instance to output a debug message.
    *   It prints a descriptive string: `'Built Google Forms list responses URL'`.
    *   It also includes an object `{ finalUrl }`. This will typically output the actual generated URL, making it very helpful for debugging to see exactly what URL is being constructed and used.

```typescript
  return finalUrl
}
```
*   **`return finalUrl`**: The function returns the fully constructed URL string.

#### **`buildGetResponseUrl` Function**

This function constructs the URL required to fetch a single, specific response for a given Google Form.

```typescript
export function buildGetResponseUrl(params: { formId: string; responseId: string }): string {
```
*   **`export function buildGetResponseUrl(...)`**: Declares a function named `buildGetResponseUrl`.
    *   **`export`**: Makes this function available for other files.
    *   **`params: { formId: string; responseId: string }`**: Defines the function's input parameters.
        *   `formId: string`: The required identifier of the Google Form.
        *   `responseId: string`: The required identifier of the specific response you want to retrieve.
    *   **`: string`**: Specifies that the function will return a string (the complete API URL).

```typescript
  const { formId, responseId } = params
```
*   **`const { formId, responseId } = params`**: Similar to the previous function, this uses object destructuring to extract `formId` and `responseId` from the `params` object for easier access.

```typescript
  const finalUrl = `${FORMS_API_BASE}/forms/${encodeURIComponent(formId)}/responses/${encodeURIComponent(responseId)}`
```
*   **`const finalUrl = ...`**: This line directly constructs the full URL string using a template literal.
    *   `FORMS_API_BASE`: The base API URL.
    *   `/forms/`: Static path segment.
    *   **`encodeURIComponent(formId)`**: Encodes the form ID for URL safety, just as in the previous function.
    *   `/responses/`: Static path segment.
    *   **`encodeURIComponent(responseId)`**: Similarly, encodes the `responseId` to ensure it's safe and correctly formatted within the URL path.
    *   The structure is `/forms/{formId}/responses/{responseId}`, which is the standard Google Forms API path for getting a single response.

```typescript
  logger.debug('Built Google Forms get response URL', { finalUrl })
```
*   **`logger.debug(...)`**: Logs the final URL for debugging purposes, indicating that a URL for getting a single response has been built, and showing the actual `finalUrl` string.

```typescript
  return finalUrl
}
```
*   **`return finalUrl`**: The function returns the fully constructed URL string for fetching a single response.
