This TypeScript file defines a configuration for a "Google Search" tool, designed to be used within a larger system (likely an AI agent framework or a tool orchestrator). It acts as a blueprint, specifying everything needed to integrate and execute Google Custom Search API requests.

---

### **Purpose of this File**

At its core, this file serves to *encapsulate* the details of interacting with the Google Custom Search API. Instead of having various parts of an application directly know how to make a Google search request, parse its response, or understand its parameters, they can simply refer to this `searchTool` configuration.

**In simpler terms:** Imagine you have a smart assistant that needs to search the internet. This file tells the assistant:
1.  **"How to ask Google for information?"** (What inputs does Google need?)
2.  **"How to make the actual request?"** (What URL to call, what method to use?)
3.  **"How to understand Google's answer?"** (How to interpret the data Google sends back?)
4.  **"What kind of information can I expect back?"** (What's the structure of the search results?)

By defining this `ToolConfig`, the system gains the ability to use Google Search as a modular "tool," making it easy to integrate, manage, and potentially swap out in the future.

---

### **Simplified Complex Logic**

The most "complex" parts of this file are not about advanced algorithms, but rather about **structuring information** and **robust data handling**:

1.  **`URLSearchParams` for Request URLs**: Building URLs with query parameters can be tricky, especially with special characters. The `URLSearchParams` object is a standard, robust way to construct these, ensuring parameters are correctly encoded.
2.  **`transformResponse` for Data Consistency**: When fetching data from an external API, you can't always guarantee the exact structure. The `transformResponse` function is crucial for:
    *   **Parsing JSON**: Turning the raw text response into a JavaScript object.
    *   **Providing Defaults**: If certain parts of the expected data are missing (e.g., `data.items` or `data.searchInformation`), it provides sensible empty arrays or default objects. This prevents errors down the line and ensures the tool always returns a consistent structure, even for empty or partial results.
3.  **`ToolConfig` as a Contract**: The entire `searchTool` object is a detailed contract. It tells the system exactly what inputs it takes (`params`), how it performs its action (`request`), and what kind of output it produces (`outputs`), allowing for type-checking and automated integration.

### **Line-by-Line Explanation**

Let's break down the code:

```typescript
import type { GoogleSearchParams, GoogleSearchResponse } from '@/tools/google/types'
import type { ToolConfig } from '@/tools/types'
```

*   **`import type { GoogleSearchParams, GoogleSearchResponse } from '@/tools/google/types'`**: This line imports two type definitions.
    *   `GoogleSearchParams`: Defines the expected structure for the input parameters when making a Google search request (e.g., what `query`, `apiKey`, etc., look like).
    *   `GoogleSearchResponse`: Defines the expected structure of the *raw* response data that the Google Custom Search API would return.
    *   `type` keyword: This indicates that these are only type imports, meaning they are used for compile-time type checking and don't generate any JavaScript code at runtime.
    *   `@/tools/google/types`: This is an alias for a file path, likely pointing to `src/tools/google/types.ts` in the project structure, where these types are defined.

*   **`import type { ToolConfig } from '@/tools/types'`**: This line imports the `ToolConfig` type.
    *   `ToolConfig`: This is a generic type that defines the overall structure expected for *any* tool configuration within the system. It likely takes generic arguments for parameters and response types to make it flexible.
    *   `@/tools/types`: Another alias, pointing to a file that defines common types for all tools.

---

```typescript
export const searchTool: ToolConfig<GoogleSearchParams, GoogleSearchResponse> = {
```

*   **`export const searchTool`**: This declares a constant variable named `searchTool` and makes it available for other files to import and use (`export`).
*   **`: ToolConfig<GoogleSearchParams, GoogleSearchResponse>`**: This is a type annotation. It tells TypeScript that `searchTool` must conform to the `ToolConfig` structure.
    *   `<GoogleSearchParams, GoogleSearchResponse>`: These are type arguments passed to the generic `ToolConfig`. They specify that this particular tool will accept `GoogleSearchParams` as its input parameters and expects a raw `GoogleSearchResponse` from the external API call before transformation.
*   **`=`**: Assigns an object literal to `searchTool`, which contains all the configuration details.

---

```typescript
  id: 'google_search',
  name: 'Google Search',
  description: 'Search the web with the Custom Search API',
  version: '1.0.0',
```

These are basic metadata fields for the tool:
*   **`id: 'google_search'`**: A unique identifier for this tool within the system.
*   **`name: 'Google Search'`**: A human-readable name for the tool.
*   **`description: 'Search the web with the Custom Search API'`**: A brief explanation of what the tool does. This is often used for documentation or by AI agents to understand when to use the tool.
*   **`version: '1.0.0'`**: The version number of this tool configuration.

```typescript
  params: {
    query: {
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
      visibility: 'user-or-llm',
      description: 'The search query to execute',
    },
    searchEngineId: {
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
      visibility: 'user-only',
      description: 'Custom Search Engine ID',
    },
    num: {
      type: 'string', // Treated as string for compatibility with tool interfaces
      required: false,
      visibility: 'user-only',
      description: 'Number of results to return (default: 10, max: 10)',
    },
    apiKey: {
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
      visibility: 'user-only',
      description: 'Google API key',
    },
  },
```

This `params` object defines all the input parameters this tool expects. Each parameter is an object with specific properties:

*   **`query`**:
    *   **`type: 'string'`**: The search query must be a string.
    *   **`required: true`**: This parameter is mandatory for the tool to function.
    *   **`visibility: 'user-or-llm'`**: This parameter can be provided either directly by a user or generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) if this tool is integrated with one.
    *   **`description: 'The search query to execute'`**: Explains the purpose of this parameter.

*   **`searchEngineId`**:
    *   **`type: 'string'`**: The ID of the Google Custom Search Engine (CSE) to use.
    *   **`required: true`**: Mandatory.
    *   **`visibility: 'user-only'`**: This parameter is expected to be provided by a human user or configured beforehand, not something an LLM would typically generate on the fly.
    *   **`description: 'Custom Search Engine ID'`**: Explains its purpose.

*   **`num`**:
    *   **`type: 'string'`**: Although representing a number, it's treated as a string here for consistency with typical API interfaces that might expect all query parameters as strings.
    *   **`required: false`**: This parameter is optional. If not provided, the API will use its default (usually 10).
    *   **`visibility: 'user-only'`**: Similar to `searchEngineId`, this is likely a configuration set by a human user, not an LLM.
    *   **`description: 'Number of results to return (default: 10, max: 10)'`**: Provides usage details.

*   **`apiKey`**:
    *   **`type: 'string'`**: The Google API key required for authentication.
    *   **`required: true`**: Mandatory for API access.
    *   **`visibility: 'user-only'`**: A sensitive credential, expected from a user or environment configuration.
    *   **`description: 'Google API key'`**: Explains its purpose.

```typescript
  request: {
    url: (params: GoogleSearchParams) => {
      const baseUrl = 'https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1'
      const searchParams = new URLSearchParams()

      // Add required parameters
      searchParams.append('key', params.apiKey)
      searchParams.append('q', params.query)
      searchParams.append('cx', params.searchEngineId)

      // Add optional parameter
      if (params.num) {
        searchParams.append('num', params.num.toString())
      }

      return `${baseUrl}?${searchParams.toString()}`
    },
    method: 'GET',
    headers: () => ({
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    }),
  },
```

This `request` object defines how the HTTP request to the Google Custom Search API should be constructed and sent.

*   **`url: (params: GoogleSearchParams) => { ... }`**: This is a function that dynamically constructs the full URL for the API request based on the provided `params`.
    *   **`const baseUrl = 'https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1'`**: Defines the base URL for the Google Custom Search API endpoint.
    *   **`const searchParams = new URLSearchParams()`**: Creates a new `URLSearchParams` object. This is a standard Web API feature that simplifies adding and encoding query parameters to a URL.
    *   **`searchParams.append('key', params.apiKey)`**: Adds the `apiKey` from the input `params` as a query parameter named `key`.
    *   **`searchParams.append('q', params.query)`**: Adds the search `query` from `params` as a query parameter named `q`.
    *   **`searchParams.append('cx', params.searchEngineId)`**: Adds the `searchEngineId` from `params` as a query parameter named `cx` (which Google uses for Custom Search Engine ID).
    *   **`if (params.num) { searchParams.append('num', params.num.toString()) }`**: Checks if the optional `num` parameter was provided. If it exists, it's added as a query parameter named `num`, ensuring it's converted to a string.
    *   **`return `${baseUrl}?${searchParams.toString()}` `**: Combines the base URL with the string representation of all collected query parameters (e.g., `?key=YOUR_KEY&q=search+term&cx=YOUR_CX&num=5`) to form the complete request URL.

*   **`method: 'GET'`**: Specifies that the HTTP request should use the GET method, which is standard for retrieving data.

*   **`headers: () => ({ 'Content-Type': 'application/json' })`**: This is a function that returns an object defining the HTTP headers for the request.
    *   **`'Content-Type': 'application/json'`**: Sets the `Content-Type` header, indicating that the client expects JSON in response (though for a GET request, this header is often less critical than for POST/PUT).

```typescript
  transformResponse: async (response: Response) => {
    const data = await response.json()

    return {
      success: true,
      output: {
        items: data.items || [],
        searchInformation: data.searchInformation || {
          totalResults: '0',
          searchTime: 0,
          formattedSearchTime: '0',
          formattedTotalResults: '0',
        },
      },
    }
  },
```

This `transformResponse` function is a crucial part of the tool. It takes the raw HTTP response received from the Google API and converts it into a standardized, predictable output format for the rest of the system.

*   **`async (response: Response) => { ... }`**: This is an asynchronous function that takes a standard `Response` object (from a `fetch` call) as input.
*   **`const data = await response.json()`**: The `response.json()` method asynchronously parses the body of the HTTP response as JSON. The `await` keyword ensures this operation completes before proceeding, and the resulting JavaScript object is stored in the `data` variable.
*   **`return { success: true, output: { ... } }`**: The function returns a structured object, typically indicating whether the operation was `success`ful and containing the actual `output`.
    *   **`success: true`**: Assumes the HTTP request itself was successful (e.g., a 2xx status code). Error handling for non-2xx responses would typically happen at a higher level or be integrated here.
    *   **`output: { ... }`**: Contains the actual processed data from the Google search.
        *   **`items: data.items || []`**: Retrieves the `items` (individual search results) from the parsed `data`. The `|| []` is a very important part: if `data.items` is `undefined` or `null` (meaning Google returned no search results or the field was missing), it defaults to an empty array (`[]`). This ensures that `items` is always an array, preventing downstream errors.
        *   **`searchInformation: data.searchInformation || { ... }`**: Retrieves `searchInformation` (metadata about the search, like total results and search time). Again, the `|| { ... }` provides a default object with sensible zero/empty values if `data.searchInformation` is missing. This guarantees a consistent structure even when no search information is provided by the API.

```typescript
  outputs: {
    items: {
      type: 'array',
      description: 'Array of search results from Google',
      items: {
        type: 'object',
        properties: {
          title: { type: 'string', description: 'Title of the search result' },
          link: { type: 'string', description: 'URL of the search result' },
          snippet: { type: 'string', description: 'Snippet or description of the search result' },
          displayLink: { type: 'string', description: 'Display URL', optional: true },
          pagemap: { type: 'object', description: 'Additional page metadata', optional: true },
        },
      },
    },
    searchInformation: {
      type: 'object',
      description: 'Information about the search query and results',
      properties: {
        totalResults: { type: 'string', description: 'Total number of search results available' },
        searchTime: { type: 'number', description: 'Time taken to perform the search in seconds' },
        formattedSearchTime: { type: 'string', description: 'Formatted search time for display' },
        formattedTotalResults: {
          type: 'string',
          description: 'Formatted total results count for display',
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

This `outputs` object describes the expected structure of the *successful* data returned by the `transformResponse` function. This is essentially a schema or contract for the tool's output, allowing other parts of the system (like an AI agent parsing tool outputs) to understand what to expect.

*   **`items`**: Describes the array of individual search results.
    *   **`type: 'array'`**: Indicates that `items` will be an array.
    *   **`description: 'Array of search results from Google'`**: Explains the content.
    *   **`items: { ... }`**: Describes the structure of *each element* within the `items` array.
        *   **`type: 'object'`**: Each item is an object.
        *   **`properties: { ... }`**: Defines the expected keys and their types within each search result object.
            *   **`title: { type: 'string', description: 'Title of the search result' }`**: The title of the webpage.
            *   **`link: { type: 'string', description: 'URL of the search result' }`**: The URL of the webpage.
            *   **`snippet: { type: 'string', description: 'Snippet or description of the search result' }`**: A short summary of the content.
            *   **`displayLink: { type: 'string', description: 'Display URL', optional: true }`**: An optional, user-friendly URL.
            *   **`pagemap: { type: 'object', description: 'Additional page metadata', optional: true }`**: Optional, structured data about the page.

*   **`searchInformation`**: Describes the object containing metadata about the overall search.
    *   **`type: 'object'`**: Indicates that `searchInformation` will be an object.
    *   **`description: 'Information about the search query and results'`**: Explains its content.
    *   **`properties: { ... }`**: Defines the expected keys and their types within the `searchInformation` object.
        *   **`totalResults: { type: 'string', description: 'Total number of search results available' }`**: The total count of results as a string.
        *   **`searchTime: { type: 'number', description: 'Time taken to perform the search in seconds' }`**: The time taken for the search as a number.
        *   **`formattedSearchTime: { type: 'string', description: 'Formatted search time for display' }`**: The search time formatted for display.
        *   **`formattedTotalResults: { type: 'string', description: 'Formatted total results count for display' }`**: The total results count formatted for display.

This detailed `outputs` schema allows for strong typing and validation throughout the application when consuming the results of the `searchTool`.
