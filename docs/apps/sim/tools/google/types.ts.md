This TypeScript file is a blueprint for how your application interacts with a "Google Search" tool. It defines the exact structure of the data you need to send to the Google Search tool (`GoogleSearchParams`) and the exact structure of the data you expect to receive back from it (`GoogleSearchResponse`).

Think of it like this: if you were ordering a specific coffee, `GoogleSearchParams` would be the order form specifying "latte, extra shot, almond milk." `GoogleSearchResponse` would be the receipt and the description of the coffee itself once it's made, detailing "Latte, 16oz, 2 shots espresso, almond milk, 140 degrees F."

By defining these structures using TypeScript interfaces, your application gains several benefits:
1.  **Type Safety**: TypeScript can catch errors if you try to send the wrong type of data (e.g., a number instead of a string for the query) or if you try to access a property that doesn't exist in the response.
2.  **Clarity and Documentation**: Anyone looking at this file instantly understands what inputs the Google Search tool expects and what outputs it provides.
3.  **Autocompletion**: Your IDE (like VS Code) can provide intelligent autocompletion suggestions as you work with these types, speeding up development.

### Simplified Logic Explanation

At its core, this file defines two main things:

1.  **`GoogleSearchParams`**: This describes the *input* you need to provide to perform a Google search. It tells you what information (like your search query, API key, etc.) is mandatory and what is optional.
2.  **`GoogleSearchResponse`**: This describes the *output* you get back from a successful Google search. It specifies that the response will contain an `output` object, which in turn has:
    *   `items`: A list of individual search results (each with a title, link, snippet, etc.).
    *   `searchInformation`: Details about the search itself (like total results found and how long it took).

The `extends ToolResponse` part simply means that the `GoogleSearchResponse` will also have some common properties that *all* tool responses in your system share, ensuring consistency.

### Line-by-Line Explanation

Let's break down each part of the code:

```typescript
import type { ToolResponse } from '@/tools/types'
```

*   **`import type`**: This is a TypeScript-specific import keyword. It means you are only importing a *type* definition, not any actual JavaScript code that would run at runtime. This helps keep your compiled JavaScript smaller and cleaner.
*   **`{ ToolResponse }`**: We are importing a type named `ToolResponse`.
*   **`from '@/tools/types'`**: This specifies the file path from where `ToolResponse` is imported. The `@/` is typically a path alias configured in your project's `tsconfig.json` (e.g., pointing to your `src` directory), making imports cleaner.
*   **Purpose**: This line brings in a base interface that `GoogleSearchResponse` will extend, ensuring that all tool responses in your application share a consistent foundation.

```typescript
export interface GoogleSearchParams {
  query: string
  apiKey: string
  searchEngineId: string
  num?: number | string
}
```

*   **`export interface GoogleSearchParams`**: This declares a new TypeScript interface named `GoogleSearchParams` and makes it available (`export`) for use in other files. This interface defines the expected shape of an object that will be used as input parameters for a Google search.
*   **`query: string`**:
    *   `query`: This is a property name.
    *   `string`: This specifies that the value for `query` must be a string (e.g., `"typescript interfaces"`). This property is mandatory.
    *   **Explanation**: This is the actual text you want to search for on Google.
*   **`apiKey: string`**:
    *   `apiKey`: Property name.
    *   `string`: Type. This property is mandatory.
    *   **Explanation**: This is your unique key provided by Google to access their Custom Search API. It authenticates your requests.
*   **`searchEngineId: string`**:
    *   `searchEngineId`: Property name.
    *   `string`: Type. This property is mandatory.
    *   **Explanation**: This is the unique identifier for the specific Google Custom Search Engine you've configured (e.g., if you've set up a search engine just for your blog).
*   **`num?: number | string`**:
    *   `num`: Property name.
    *   `?`: The question mark makes this property *optional*. You don't have to provide it.
    *   `number | string`: This specifies that if `num` is provided, its value can be either a `number` (e.g., `10` for 10 results) or a `string` (e.g., `"10"`). Some APIs might expect numerical values as strings.
    *   **Explanation**: This optional parameter determines how many search results you want to retrieve per request.

```typescript
export interface GoogleSearchResponse extends ToolResponse {
  output: {
    items: Array<{
      title: string
      link: string
      snippet: string
      displayLink?: string
      pagemap?: Record<string, any>
    }>
    searchInformation: {
      totalResults: string
      searchTime: number
      formattedSearchTime: string
      formattedTotalResults: string
    }
  }
}
```

*   **`export interface GoogleSearchResponse`**: Declares and exports an interface named `GoogleSearchResponse`. This interface defines the structure of the data you receive back from a successful Google search operation.
*   **`extends ToolResponse`**: This is an important part! It means that `GoogleSearchResponse` will inherit all the properties defined in the `ToolResponse` interface (which we imported earlier), *in addition* to the properties defined within this interface. This is a common pattern for creating consistent response structures across different tools.
*   **`output: { ... }`**:
    *   `output`: This is a mandatory property. Its value is an object, containing the primary data of the search results. This kind of nesting is often used to encapsulate the main data payload.
*   **`items: Array<{ ... }>`**:
    *   `items`: A property inside the `output` object.
    *   `Array<{ ... }>`: This indicates that `items` will be an *array* (a list) where each element in the array is an object matching the structure defined within the curly braces. Each of these objects represents a single search result.
        *   **`title: string`**: The main title of the search result (e.g., "Google Search - Wikipedia").
        *   **`link: string`**: The URL (web address) of the search result.
        *   **`snippet: string`**: A short textual summary or description extracted from the web page.
        *   **`displayLink?: string`**: An *optional* property. This is often a more user-friendly version of the `link` (e.g., `en.wikipedia.org` instead of the full URL).
        *   **`pagemap?: Record<string, any>`**: An *optional* property.
            *   `Record<string, any>`: This is a TypeScript utility type meaning "an object where keys are strings, and values can be of any type." This property is used to hold structured data found on the web page, often related to schema.org markup (e.g., author, publication date, images associated with the page), which can be highly variable.
*   **`searchInformation: { ... }`**:
    *   `searchInformation`: Another mandatory property inside the `output` object. Its value is an object containing metadata about the search operation itself, rather than the individual results.
        *   **`totalResults: string`**: The total estimated number of results found for the query (e.g., `"8,750,000,000"`). It's a string because it might contain commas.
        *   **`searchTime: number`**: The time taken to perform the search, in seconds (e.g., `0.345`). This is a numerical value.
        *   **`formattedSearchTime: string`**: The `searchTime` formatted as a user-friendly string (e.g., `"0.34 seconds"`).
        *   **`formattedTotalResults: string`**: The `totalResults` formatted as a user-friendly string (e.g., `"About 8,750,000,000 results"`).

In summary, this file provides a robust and clear contract for working with Google Search functionality in your TypeScript application, ensuring that both the requests you make and the responses you receive adhere to a well-defined structure.
