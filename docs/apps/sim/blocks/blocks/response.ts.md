This TypeScript file defines the configuration for a "Response Block" within a workflow automation platform, likely designed for building and managing API workflows. It acts as a blueprint for how this specific block appears in a user interface, what options it presents to users, and what kind of data it processes and outputs.

---

### Purpose of this File

This file exports a constant named `ResponseBlock`, which is an object conforming to the `BlockConfig` type. In essence, it's a declarative definition that tells the workflow platform:

1.  **What this block is called and what it does:** Its name, description, and purpose.
2.  **How it looks:** Its icon, background color, and category in a UI.
3.  **How users configure it:** The various input fields (dropdowns, code editors, text inputs, tables) that appear when a user adds this block to a workflow.
4.  **How it integrates with AI assistance:** If applicable, it defines the prompt and behavior for an AI "wand" feature within its configuration.
5.  **What data it expects:** The inputs it receives from previous steps in a workflow.
6.  **What data it produces:** The outputs it makes available to subsequent steps.

The primary function of the `ResponseBlock` itself is to construct and send a structured HTTP API response, often as the final step in a workflow triggered by an API call.

### Detailed Explanation

Let's break down the code section by section:

#### 1. Imports

```typescript
import { ResponseIcon } from '@/components/icons'
import type { BlockConfig } from '@/blocks/types'
import type { ResponseBlockOutput } from '@/tools/response/types'
```

*   **`import { ResponseIcon } from '@/components/icons'`**: This line imports a UI component named `ResponseIcon`. This component is likely an SVG icon or similar visual element that will be used to represent the `ResponseBlock` in the platform's user interface (e.g., in a block palette or on the workflow canvas). The `@/components/icons` path suggests it's coming from an internal library of icons.
*   **`import type { BlockConfig } from '@/blocks/types'`**: This imports a TypeScript *type* named `BlockConfig`. This type defines the expected structure and properties for any workflow block configuration object in the system. Using `type` ensures that this import is only for type-checking and doesn't generate any runtime JavaScript code.
*   **`import type { ResponseBlockOutput } from '@/tools/response/types'`**: This imports another TypeScript *type* named `ResponseBlockOutput`. This type specifically defines the shape of the data that the `ResponseBlock` is expected to output when it runs.

#### 2. The `ResponseBlock` Configuration Object

```typescript
export const ResponseBlock: BlockConfig<ResponseBlockOutput> = {
  // ... configuration properties ...
}
```

This is the main declaration.
*   **`export const ResponseBlock`**: Declares a constant variable named `ResponseBlock` and makes it available for other files to import.
*   **`: BlockConfig<ResponseBlockOutput>`**: This is a TypeScript type annotation. It specifies that the `ResponseBlock` object *must* conform to the `BlockConfig` type. The `<ResponseBlockOutput>` part indicates that this specific `BlockConfig` is configured to produce outputs that match the `ResponseBlockOutput` type. This provides strong type-checking, ensuring the configuration is valid and consistent.

Now, let's look at the properties within this configuration object:

##### Basic Information

```typescript
  type: 'response',
  name: 'Response',
  description: 'Send structured API response',
  longDescription:
    'Integrate Response into the workflow. Can send build or edit structured responses into a final workflow response.',
  docsLink: 'https://docs.sim.ai/blocks/response',
  bestPractices: `
  - Only use this if the trigger block is the API Trigger.
  - Prefer the builder mode over the editor mode.
  - This is usually used as the last block in the workflow.
  `,
```

*   **`type: 'response'`**: A unique string identifier for this specific block type. The platform uses this ID internally (e.g., for saving, loading, and identifying blocks).
*   **`name: 'Response'`**: The human-readable name of the block, displayed in the UI to users (e.g., in a block palette or on the workflow canvas).
*   **`description: 'Send structured API response'`**: A short, concise summary of what the block does, often displayed as a tooltip or brief label.
*   **`longDescription: '...'`**: A more detailed explanation of the block's capabilities and purpose, providing more context for users.
*   **`docsLink: 'https://docs.sim.ai/blocks/response'`**: A URL pointing to external documentation for this block. This allows users to quickly access comprehensive guides and information.
*   **`bestPractices: \`...\``**: A multi-line string (using backticks for a template literal) that provides recommendations and guidelines for effective use of the block. This includes important advice like:
    *   It should only be used with an "API Trigger" (meaning the workflow was started by an incoming API call).
    *   "Builder" mode is preferred over "Editor" mode for defining the response (we'll see these modes later).
    *   It's typically the final block in a workflow.

##### UI & Categorization

```typescript
  category: 'blocks',
  bgColor: '#2F55FF',
  icon: ResponseIcon,
```

*   **`category: 'blocks'`**: Defines the category this block belongs to, used for organizing blocks in the UI (e.g., in a sidebar or search filter).
*   **`bgColor: '#2F55FF'`**: A hexadecimal color code that specifies the background color for this block in the UI, helping with visual identification and branding.
*   **`icon: ResponseIcon`**: References the `ResponseIcon` component imported earlier, providing the visual icon for the block in the user interface.

##### Sub-Blocks (User Interface Controls)

```typescript
  subBlocks: [
    // ... individual UI controls ...
  ],
```

This is a critical property. `subBlocks` is an array of objects, where each object defines an individual user interface control or input field that appears *within* the `ResponseBlock`'s configuration panel when a user selects it in the workflow builder. These are the fields users interact with to customize the block's behavior.

Let's examine each sub-block:

###### 1. `dataMode` (Dropdown for Response Data Method)

```typescript
    {
      id: 'dataMode',
      title: 'Response Data Mode',
      type: 'dropdown',
      layout: 'full',
      options: [
        { label: 'Builder', id: 'structured' },
        { label: 'Editor', id: 'json' },
      ],
      value: () => 'structured',
      description: 'Choose how to define your response data structure',
    },
```

*   **`id: 'dataMode'`**: A unique identifier for this particular UI control.
*   **`title: 'Response Data Mode'`**: The label displayed next to the dropdown in the UI.
*   **`type: 'dropdown'`**: Specifies that this control is a dropdown menu.
*   **`layout: 'full'`**: Indicates that this control should take up the full width of its container.
*   **`options: [...]`**: An array defining the choices available in the dropdown:
    *   `{ label: 'Builder', id: 'structured' }`: The user-friendly label is "Builder", and its internal value is "structured".
    *   `{ label: 'Editor', id: 'json' }`: The user-friendly label is "Editor", and its internal value is "json".
*   **`value: () => 'structured'`**: A function that returns the default selected value for this dropdown. Here, it defaults to `'structured'`, meaning "Builder" mode will be selected initially.
*   **`description: 'Choose how to define your response data structure'`**: Explanatory text shown to the user for this control.

###### 2. `builderData` (Structured Response Builder)

```typescript
    {
      id: 'builderData',
      title: 'Response Structure',
      type: 'response-format',
      layout: 'full',
      condition: { field: 'dataMode', value: 'structured' },
      description:
        'Define the structure of your response data. Use <variable.name> in field names to reference workflow variables.',
    },
```

*   **`id: 'builderData'`**: Identifier for this control.
*   **`title: 'Response Structure'`**: Label for the builder interface.
*   **`type: 'response-format'`**: This is likely a custom UI component specific to the platform, designed to help users graphically build a JSON-like response structure without writing raw JSON.
*   **`layout: 'full'`**: Full width layout.
*   **`condition: { field: 'dataMode', value: 'structured' }`**: **This is important!** This control will *only be visible* if the `dataMode` dropdown (defined above) has its value set to `'structured'` (i.e., "Builder" mode is selected). This creates a dynamic UI where content changes based on user choices.
*   **`description: '...'`**: Instructions for using the builder, including how to reference workflow variables (e.g., `<variable.name>`).

###### 3. `data` (JSON Code Editor)

```typescript
    {
      id: 'data',
      title: 'Response Data',
      type: 'code',
      layout: 'full',
      placeholder: '{\n  "message": "Hello world",\n  "userId": "<variable.userId>"\n}',
      language: 'json',
      condition: { field: 'dataMode', value: 'json' },
      description:
        'Data that will be sent as the response body on API calls. Use <variable.name> to reference workflow variables.',
      wandConfig: {
        enabled: true,
        maintainHistory: true,
        prompt: `You are an expert JSON programmer.
Generate ONLY the raw JSON object based on the user's request.
The output MUST be a single, valid JSON object, starting with { and ending with }.

Current response: {context}

Do not include any explanations, markdown formatting, or other text outside the JSON object.

You have access to the following variables you can use to generate the JSON body:
- 'params' (object): Contains input parameters derived from the JSON schema. Access these directly using the parameter name wrapped in angle brackets, e.g., '<paramName>'. Do NOT use 'params.paramName'.
- 'environmentVariables' (object): Contains environment variables. Reference these using the double curly brace syntax: '{{ENV_VAR_NAME}}'. Do NOT use 'environmentVariables.VAR_NAME' or env.

Example:
{
  "name": "<block.agent.response.content>",
  "age": <block.function.output.age>,
  "success": true
}`,
        placeholder: 'Describe the API response structure you need...',
        generationType: 'json-object',
      },
    },
```

*   **`id: 'data'`**: Identifier for this control.
*   **`title: 'Response Data'`**: Label for the code editor.
*   **`type: 'code'`**: Specifies a code editor component.
*   **`layout: 'full'`**: Full width.
*   **`placeholder: '...'`**: Example JSON content shown in the editor when it's empty, illustrating the expected format and variable usage.
*   **`language: 'json'`**: Configures the code editor for JSON syntax highlighting and formatting.
*   **`condition: { field: 'dataMode', value: 'json' }`**: This control is *only visible* if the `dataMode` dropdown is set to `'json'` (i.e., "Editor" mode is selected). This is the counterpart to `builderData`.
*   **`description: '...'`**: Instructions for using the JSON editor, including how to reference workflow variables.
*   **`wandConfig: { ... }`**: This nested object configures an AI-powered "magic wand" feature for the JSON editor, allowing users to generate JSON using natural language prompts.
    *   **`enabled: true`**: Activates the AI assistance.
    *   **`maintainHistory: true`**: The AI assistant remembers previous interactions.
    *   **`prompt: \`...\``**: This is the core instruction set (system prompt) given to the AI model. It carefully defines the AI's persona, expected output format (raw JSON only), and the specific syntax for referencing available variables (`<paramName>`, `{{ENV_VAR_NAME}}`). This helps guide the AI to produce correct and usable JSON.
    *   **`placeholder: 'Describe the API response structure you need...'`**: Text displayed in the AI's input field before the user types their request.
    *   **`generationType: 'json-object'`**: Specifies that the AI is expected to generate a complete JSON object.

###### 4. `status` (HTTP Status Code Input)

```typescript
    {
      id: 'status',
      title: 'Status Code',
      type: 'short-input',
      layout: 'half',
      placeholder: '200',
      description: 'HTTP status code (default: 200)',
    },
```

*   **`id: 'status'`**: Identifier for this control.
*   **`title: 'Status Code'`**: Label for the input field.
*   **`type: 'short-input'`**: A simple, single-line text input field.
*   **`layout: 'half'`**: This control takes up half the width of its container, suggesting it might sit alongside another half-width control.
*   **`placeholder: '200'`**: Example value shown in the input field when it's empty, also indicating the default.
*   **`description: 'HTTP status code (default: 200)'`**: Explanatory text.

###### 5. `headers` (Response Headers Table)

```typescript
    {
      id: 'headers',
      title: 'Response Headers',
      type: 'table',
      layout: 'full',
      columns: ['Key', 'Value'],
      description: 'Additional HTTP headers to include in the response',
    },
```

*   **`id: 'headers'`**: Identifier for this control.
*   **`title: 'Response Headers'`**: Label for the table.
*   **`type: 'table'`**: A UI component that allows users to add key-value pairs in a tabular format.
*   **`layout: 'full'`**: Full width.
*   **`columns: ['Key', 'Value']`**: Defines the column headers for the table interface.
*   **`description: 'Additional HTTP headers to include in the response'`**: Explanatory text.

##### Tools Access

```typescript
  tools: { access: [] },
```

*   **`tools: { access: [] }`**: This property defines which internal platform tools or services this block requires access to. An empty array `[]` indicates that this `ResponseBlock` doesn't need any special tool access permissions.

##### Inputs (Runtime Data Received by the Block)

```typescript
  inputs: {
    dataMode: {
      type: 'string',
      description: 'Response data definition mode',
    },
    builderData: {
      type: 'json',
      description: 'Structured response data',
    },
    data: {
      type: 'json',
      description: 'JSON response body',
    },
    status: {
      type: 'number',
      description: 'HTTP status code',
    },
    headers: {
      type: 'json',
      description: 'Response headers',
    },
  },
```

This section defines the data that the `ResponseBlock` *expects to receive* during workflow execution. These are the actual values that will be used to construct the final API response. Notice how the `id`s from `subBlocks` often correspond to keys here, meaning the values set in the UI configuration become the block's runtime inputs.

*   **`dataMode: { type: 'string', description: '...' }`**: Expects a string indicating whether the response data was defined via "structured" (builder) or "json" (editor) mode.
*   **`builderData: { type: 'json', description: '...' }`**: Expects JSON data generated by the "Builder" UI mode.
*   **`data: { type: 'json', description: '...' }`**: Expects raw JSON data entered in the "Editor" UI mode.
*   **`status: { type: 'number', description: '...' }`**: Expects a number representing the HTTP status code.
*   **`headers: { type: 'json', description: '...' }`**: Expects JSON representing the HTTP headers (e.g., an object like `{ "Content-Type": "application/json" }`).

##### Outputs (Runtime Data Produced by the Block)

```typescript
  outputs: {
    data: { type: 'json', description: 'Response data' },
    status: { type: 'number', description: 'HTTP status code' },
    headers: { type: 'json', description: 'Response headers' },
  },
```

This section defines the data that the `ResponseBlock` *will make available* to subsequent blocks in the workflow (though for a `ResponseBlock`, it's usually the final block, so these outputs would typically be used internally by the platform to send the actual API response).

*   **`data: { type: 'json', description: 'Response data' }`**: The final JSON body of the API response.
*   **`status: { type: 'number', description: 'HTTP status code' }`**: The final HTTP status code.
*   **`headers: { type: 'json', description: 'Response headers' }`**: The final HTTP headers.

---

In summary, this `ResponseBlock` configuration is a comprehensive definition that allows a workflow platform to render a user-friendly UI for configuring API responses, integrate AI assistance, and define the expected data flow for constructing and delivering those responses.
