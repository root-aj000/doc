This TypeScript file is a configuration blueprint for a "OneDrive Block" within a larger workflow or low-code automation platform. Imagine a visual builder where users can drag and drop components to create automated tasks. This file defines exactly how the OneDrive component behaves, what options it presents to the user, and how it translates those user choices into calls to backend services.

In simpler terms, it's like a detailed instruction manual for a specific LEGOÂ® brick:
*   **What it does:** Allows interaction with Microsoft OneDrive (uploading files, creating folders, listing files).
*   **How it looks:** Defines the input fields, dropdowns, and buttons a user will see.
*   **How it works:** Specifies the rules for showing/hiding fields, validates inputs, and maps user selections to actual OneDrive API calls.

---

### Purpose of this file

The primary purpose of this file is to export a `BlockConfig` object named `OneDriveBlock`. This object acts as a declarative schema, defining all aspects of a "OneDrive" integration block for a frontend application and its backend interaction.

Specifically, it outlines:
1.  **Metadata:** Basic information like its name, description, category, and an icon.
2.  **User Interface (UI) Definition:** Which input fields (text boxes, dropdowns, file selectors, authentication inputs) are available, their labels, placeholders, and how they dynamically appear/disappear based on user choices.
3.  **Authentication Requirements:** Which permissions (scopes) are needed for OneDrive access.
4.  **Backend Tooling Integration:** How user inputs are transformed into calls to specific backend "tools" (APIs) to perform actions like uploading files, creating folders, or listing content on OneDrive.
5.  **Input/Output Schema:** What data the block expects as input and what data it will produce as output, useful for validation and downstream operations in a workflow.

### Detailed Explanation

Let's go through the code line by line.

```typescript
import { MicrosoftOneDriveIcon } from '@/components/icons'
import type { BlockConfig } from '@/blocks/types'
import { AuthMode } from '@/blocks/types'
import type { OneDriveResponse } from '@/tools/onedrive/types'
```
These lines import necessary types and components:
*   `MicrosoftOneDriveIcon`: This imports a React component (or similar UI component) that will be used as the visual icon for the OneDrive block in the user interface. The `@/components/icons` path suggests it's a custom icon from the project's component library.
*   `BlockConfig`: This imports a TypeScript `type` definition. It defines the expected structure and properties for any "block" configuration within the platform. The `OneDriveBlock` object we're defining must conform to this type.
*   `AuthMode`: This imports an `enum` (a set of named constant values) that defines different authentication methods. Here, it will specify that OneDrive uses OAuth.
*   `OneDriveResponse`: This imports a `type` definition for the expected data structure returned when a OneDrive operation is successfully completed. This helps ensure type safety when working with the block's outputs.

```typescript
export const OneDriveBlock: BlockConfig<OneDriveResponse> = {
```
This line declares and exports a constant variable named `OneDriveBlock`. It is explicitly typed as `BlockConfig<OneDriveResponse>`, meaning it's a block configuration specifically designed to handle and produce data conforming to `OneDriveResponse` type. The `{` opens the main configuration object.

```typescript
  type: 'onedrive',
  name: 'OneDrive',
  description: 'Create, upload, and list files',
  authMode: AuthMode.OAuth,
  longDescription: 'Integrate OneDrive into the workflow. Can create, upload, and list files.',
  docsLink: 'https://docs.sim.ai/tools/onedrive',
  category: 'tools',
  bgColor: '#E0E0E0',
  icon: MicrosoftOneDriveIcon,
```
These are the basic metadata properties for the OneDrive block:
*   `type: 'onedrive'`: A unique identifier string for this block type, used internally by the platform.
*   `name: 'OneDrive'`: The user-friendly display name of the block, shown in the UI.
*   `description: 'Create, upload, and list files'`: A short summary of what the block does, displayed in the UI.
*   `authMode: AuthMode.OAuth`: Specifies that this block uses OAuth (Open Authorization) for authentication, which is a standard protocol for secure delegated access.
*   `longDescription: 'Integrate OneDrive into the workflow. Can create, upload, and list files.'`: A more detailed explanation, potentially shown in a tooltip or a dedicated information panel.
*   `docsLink: 'https://docs.sim.ai/tools/onedrive'`: A URL pointing to more comprehensive documentation for this block.
*   `category: 'tools'`: Classifies the block into a category, helping users find it in a library (e.g., "tools," "data transformation," "integrations").
*   `bgColor: '#E0E0E0'`: Defines a background color for the block's visual representation in the UI.
*   `icon: MicrosoftOneDriveIcon`: Assigns the imported `MicrosoftOneDriveIcon` component to be the visual icon for this block.

---

### `subBlocks` - Defining the User Interface

This is the most extensive part of the configuration, defining all the interactive elements (inputs) that a user will see and interact with to configure the OneDrive block. Each object within this array represents a single UI component.

```typescript
  subBlocks: [
    // Operation selector
    {
      id: 'operation',
      title: 'Operation',
      type: 'dropdown',
      layout: 'full',
      options: [
        { label: 'Create Folder', id: 'create_folder' },
        { label: 'Upload File', id: 'upload' },
        { label: 'List Files', id: 'list' },
      ],
    },
```
This is the first and most critical `subBlock`: an operation selector.
*   `id: 'operation'`: Unique identifier for this input field. Its value will determine which other fields are shown.
*   `title: 'Operation'`: The label displayed to the user.
*   `type: 'dropdown'`: Specifies that this is a dropdown (select) UI element.
*   `layout: 'full'`: Indicates it should take up the full available width.
*   `options`: An array of objects defining the choices in the dropdown. Each option has a `label` (what the user sees) and an `id` (the internal value used by the system).

---

#### OneDrive Credentials

```typescript
    // One Drive Credentials
    {
      id: 'credential',
      title: 'Microsoft Account',
      type: 'oauth-input',
      layout: 'full',
      provider: 'onedrive',
      serviceId: 'onedrive',
      requiredScopes: [
        'openid', 'profile', 'email', 'Files.Read', 'Files.ReadWrite', 'offline_access',
      ],
      placeholder: 'Select Microsoft account',
    },
```
This `subBlock` configures the authentication input.
*   `id: 'credential'`: Identifier for the input where the user selects their Microsoft account.
*   `title: 'Microsoft Account'`: Label for this field.
*   `type: 'oauth-input'`: A specialized input type designed to handle OAuth credentials.
*   `provider: 'onedrive'`, `serviceId: 'onedrive'`: These likely tell the platform's authentication system which service to integrate with.
*   `requiredScopes`: An array of strings specifying the permissions the application needs from the user's Microsoft account.
    *   `openid`, `profile`, `email`: Standard scopes for user identification.
    *   `Files.Read`, `Files.ReadWrite`: Permissions to read and write files on OneDrive.
    *   `offline_access`: Allows the application to refresh tokens when the user is not actively interacting, enabling long-lived access.
*   `placeholder: 'Select Microsoft account'`: Hint text shown when no account is selected.

---

#### Fields for "Upload File" Operation

These fields only appear when the `operation` dropdown is set to `'upload'`. This is controlled by the `condition` property.

```typescript
    {
      id: 'fileName',
      title: 'File Name',
      type: 'short-input',
      layout: 'full',
      placeholder: 'Name of the file',
      condition: { field: 'operation', value: 'upload' },
    },
    {
      id: 'content',
      title: 'Content',
      type: 'long-input',
      layout: 'full',
      placeholder: 'Content to upload to the file',
      condition: { field: 'operation', value: 'upload' },
    },
```
*   `fileName`: A simple text input for the name of the file to be uploaded.
*   `content`: A multi-line text input for the actual content of the file.
*   Both use `condition: { field: 'operation', value: 'upload' }` to ensure they are only visible when the `operation` dropdown's value is `'upload'`.

```typescript
    {
      id: 'folderSelector',
      title: 'Select Parent Folder',
      type: 'file-selector',
      layout: 'full',
      canonicalParamId: 'folderId', // This is important for mapping to backend parameter
      provider: 'microsoft',
      serviceId: 'onedrive',
      requiredScopes: [ /* ... scopes ... */ ], // Same scopes as credential
      mimeType: 'application/vnd.microsoft.graph.folder', // Restricts selection to folders
      placeholder: 'Select a parent folder',
      dependsOn: ['credential'], // This field only becomes active after a credential is selected
      mode: 'basic', // This is the "basic" mode input for folder selection
      condition: { field: 'operation', value: 'upload' },
    },
    {
      id: 'manualFolderId',
      title: 'Parent Folder ID',
      type: 'short-input',
      layout: 'full',
      canonicalParamId: 'folderId', // This also maps to the same backend parameter
      placeholder: 'Enter parent folder ID (leave empty for root folder)',
      dependsOn: ['credential'],
      mode: 'advanced', // This is the "advanced" mode input for folder ID
      condition: { field: 'operation', value: 'upload' },
    },
```
These two `subBlocks` provide options for selecting the parent folder for the upload. They both map to the same backend parameter (`folderId`) but offer different UI experiences:
*   `folderSelector`: A specialized `file-selector` UI component that likely provides a tree-view or browser-like interface to select a folder visually.
    *   `canonicalParamId: 'folderId'`: This is a crucial property. It tells the system that the value from this UI field should be mapped to a backend parameter named `folderId`.
    *   `mimeType: 'application/vnd.microsoft.graph.folder'`: Ensures the selector only allows choosing folders, not files.
    *   `dependsOn: ['credential']`: This input only becomes active and usable *after* the user has selected a Microsoft account in the `credential` field.
    *   `mode: 'basic'`: Indicates this is part of the "basic" user experience, usually simpler and more visual.
*   `manualFolderId`: A simple `short-input` text box for users who prefer to manually enter a folder ID (e.g., if they know it beforehand or are using advanced scripting).
    *   `canonicalParamId: 'folderId'`: Also maps to the same `folderId` backend parameter.
    *   `mode: 'advanced'`: Indicates this is part of an "advanced" user experience, usually hidden by default and toggled by the user.
*   Both are conditioned on `operation: 'upload'`.

---

#### Fields for "Create Folder" Operation

These fields only appear when the `operation` dropdown is set to `'create_folder'`.

```typescript
    {
      id: 'folderName',
      title: 'Folder Name',
      type: 'short-input',
      layout: 'full',
      placeholder: 'Name for the new folder',
      condition: { field: 'operation', value: 'create_folder' },
    },
    {
      id: 'folderSelector', // Reused ID for folder selection
      title: 'Select Parent Folder',
      type: 'file-selector',
      layout: 'full',
      canonicalParamId: 'folderId',
      provider: 'microsoft',
      serviceId: 'onedrive',
      requiredScopes: [ /* ... scopes ... */ ],
      mimeType: 'application/vnd.microsoft.graph.folder',
      placeholder: 'Select a parent folder',
      dependsOn: ['credential'],
      mode: 'basic',
      condition: { field: 'operation', value: 'create_folder' },
    },
    // Manual Folder ID input (advanced mode)
    {
      id: 'manualFolderId', // Reused ID for manual folder ID input
      title: 'Parent Folder ID',
      type: 'short-input',
      layout: 'full',
      canonicalParamId: 'folderId',
      placeholder: 'Enter parent folder ID (leave empty for root folder)',
      dependsOn: ['credential'],
      mode: 'advanced',
      condition: { field: 'operation', value: 'create_folder' },
    },
```
*   `folderName`: A text input for the name of the new folder to be created.
*   `folderSelector` and `manualFolderId`: These are the *same definitions* as used for the "Upload File" operation, allowing users to select or manually enter a parent folder for the new folder. This reusability of UI components is efficient.
*   All are conditioned on `operation: 'create_folder'`.

---

#### Fields for "List Files" Operation

These fields only appear when the `operation` dropdown is set to `'list'`.

```typescript
    // List Fields - Folder Selector (basic mode)
    {
      id: 'folderSelector', // Reused ID
      title: 'Select Folder',
      type: 'file-selector',
      layout: 'full',
      canonicalParamId: 'folderId',
      provider: 'microsoft',
      serviceId: 'onedrive',
      requiredScopes: [ /* ... scopes ... */ ],
      mimeType: 'application/vnd.microsoft.graph.folder',
      placeholder: 'Select a folder to list files from',
      dependsOn: ['credential'],
      mode: 'basic',
      condition: { field: 'operation', value: 'list' },
    },
    // Manual Folder ID input (advanced mode)
    {
      id: 'manualFolderId', // Reused ID
      title: 'Folder ID',
      type: 'short-input',
      layout: 'full',
      canonicalParamId: 'folderId',
      placeholder: 'Enter folder ID (leave empty for root folder)',
      dependsOn: ['credential'],
      mode: 'advanced',
      condition: { field: 'operation', value: 'list' },
    },
    {
      id: 'query',
      title: 'Search Query',
      type: 'short-input',
      layout: 'full',
      placeholder: 'Search for specific files (e.g., name contains "report")',
      condition: { field: 'operation', value: 'list' },
    },
    {
      id: 'pageSize',
      title: 'Results Per Page',
      type: 'short-input',
      layout: 'full',
      placeholder: 'Number of results (default: 100, max: 1000)',
      condition: { field: 'operation', value: 'list' },
    },
  ], // End of subBlocks array
```
*   `folderSelector` and `manualFolderId`: Again, these are reused to allow users to select or manually enter a folder ID from which to list files.
*   `query`: A text input for entering a search query to filter the listed files.
*   `pageSize`: A text input to specify the maximum number of results to return per page.
*   All are conditioned on `operation: 'list'`.

### `tools` - Backend Integration Logic

This section defines how the block interacts with the backend "tools" or APIs to execute the actual OneDrive operations.

```typescript
  tools: {
    access: ['onedrive_upload', 'onedrive_create_folder', 'onedrive_list'],
    config: {
      tool: (params) => {
        switch (params.operation) {
          case 'upload':
            return 'onedrive_upload'
          case 'create_folder':
            return 'onedrive_create_folder'
          case 'list':
            return 'onedrive_list'
          default:
            throw new Error(`Invalid OneDrive operation: ${params.operation}`)
        }
      },
```
*   `access`: An array listing the specific backend "tool IDs" that this block is authorized to call. This acts as a security and permission check on the backend.
*   `config`: This object contains functions that transform the UI inputs into valid calls for the backend tools.
    *   `tool: (params) => { ... }`: This function takes all the raw UI `params` (from `subBlocks`) and determines *which specific backend tool* should be invoked.
        *   It uses a `switch` statement on `params.operation` (the value from our `operation` dropdown) to return the corresponding tool ID (e.g., `'onedrive_upload'`, `'onedrive_create_folder'`, `'onedrive_list'`).
        *   If an unknown operation is provided, it throws an error.

```typescript
      params: (params) => {
        const { credential, folderSelector, manualFolderId, mimeType, ...rest } = params

        // Use folderSelector if provided, otherwise use manualFolderId
        const effectiveFolderId = (folderSelector || manualFolderId || '').trim()

        return {
          credential,
          ...rest,
          folderId: effectiveFolderId || undefined,
          pageSize: rest.pageSize ? Number.parseInt(rest.pageSize as string, 10) : undefined,
          mimeType: mimeType,
        }
      },
    },
  }, // End of tools object
```
*   `params: (params) => { ... }`: This function takes all the raw UI `params` and transforms them into the *exact format* expected by the chosen backend tool. This is where input normalization and selection logic happen.
    *   `const { credential, folderSelector, manualFolderId, mimeType, ...rest } = params`: This line uses object destructuring. It extracts `credential`, `folderSelector`, `manualFolderId`, and `mimeType` from the `params` object, putting all *other* properties into a new `rest` object.
    *   `const effectiveFolderId = (folderSelector || manualFolderId || '').trim()`: **This is a key piece of logic.** It determines the final `folderId` to send to the backend. It prioritizes the `folderSelector` (visual selection) value. If `folderSelector` is empty, it then tries `manualFolderId`. If both are empty, it results in an empty string, which is then trimmed. This handles the 'basic' vs 'advanced' mode choice seamlessly.
    *   `return { ... }`: This returns the final object of parameters for the backend tool.
        *   `credential`: Passed directly.
        *   `...rest`: All other parameters that weren't explicitly extracted (like `fileName`, `content`, `folderName`, `query`) are passed through.
        *   `folderId: effectiveFolderId || undefined`: The determined `folderId` is included. If `effectiveFolderId` is an empty string, it's converted to `undefined` (often meaning "use the root folder" or "no folder specified").
        *   `pageSize: rest.pageSize ? Number.parseInt(rest.pageSize as string, 10) : undefined`: If `pageSize` was provided (from the UI, it's a string), it's converted to an integer using `Number.parseInt`. If not provided, it's `undefined`.
        *   `mimeType: mimeType`: The `mimeType` from the parameters is passed along.

---

### `inputs` - Schema for Block Inputs

This section defines the expected *schema* for the input data that this block can receive. This is useful for documentation, validation, or generating API definitions.

```typescript
  inputs: {
    operation: { type: 'string', description: 'Operation to perform' },
    credential: { type: 'string', description: 'Microsoft account credential' },
    // Upload and Create Folder operation inputs
    fileName: { type: 'string', description: 'File name' },
    content: { type: 'string', description: 'File content' },
    // Get Content operation inputs
    // fileId: { type: 'string', required: false }, // This line is commented out, suggesting it's not currently used or is a future consideration.
    // List operation inputs
    folderSelector: { type: 'string', description: 'Folder selector' },
    manualFolderId: { type: 'string', description: 'Manual folder ID' },
    query: { type: 'string', description: 'Search query' },
    pageSize: { type: 'number', description: 'Results per page' },
  },
```
Each property here describes an input parameter:
*   `operation`, `credential`, `fileName`, `content`, `folderSelector`, `manualFolderId`, `query`, `pageSize`: These correspond to the `id`s of the `subBlocks` and the parameters expected by the backend `tools`.
*   Each has a `type` (e.g., `'string'`, `'number'`) and a `description` for clarity.
*   The commented-out `fileId` suggests that a "Get Content" operation might have been planned or is a future feature.

---

### `outputs` - Schema for Block Outputs

This section defines the *schema* for the data that this block will produce as output after successfully executing an operation.

```typescript
  outputs: {
    file: {
      type: 'json',
      description: 'The OneDrive file object, including details such as id, name, size, and more.',
    },
    files: {
      type: 'json',
      description:
        'An array of OneDrive file objects, each containing details such as id, name, size, and more.',
    },
  },
} // End of OneDriveBlock object
```
*   `file`: This output is provided when a single file or folder is created or interacted with (e.g., after `upload` or `create_folder`). It's typed as `json` and has a description indicating it will contain details of the file/folder.
*   `files`: This output is provided when multiple files are returned (e.g., after a `list` operation). It's also typed as `json` and describes an array of file objects.

---

### Simplification of Complex Logic

The most "complex" logic in this file revolves around two main concepts:

1.  **Conditional UI (`condition` property in `subBlocks`):**
    *   **Simplified:** The `operation` dropdown acts like a master switch. When you choose "Upload File," only the fields relevant to uploading (file name, content, parent folder) appear. If you choose "Create Folder," only folder-specific fields show up. This makes the UI clean and user-friendly, preventing a cluttered interface with unnecessary fields.
    *   **How it works:** Each input field has a `condition: { field: 'operation', value: '...' }` rule. The platform reads this and only renders that field if the `operation` dropdown's current value matches the specified value.

2.  **Mapping UI inputs to Backend Parameters (`tools.config.params` function):**
    *   **Simplified:** Users interact with friendly UI elements (like a visual folder selector or a text box for a folder ID). The system then takes these inputs and translates them into a single, consistent set of parameters that the backend OneDrive API expects.
    *   **How it works:**
        *   **Operation Selection:** The `tools.config.tool` function simply looks at the chosen `operation` (e.g., "upload") and picks the correct backend action (e.g., `onedrive_upload`).
        *   **Folder ID Resolution (`effectiveFolderId`):** Both the visual `folderSelector` and the `manualFolderId` text box are designed to represent the same concept: the `folderId`. The system wisely decides which one to use: if the user selected a folder visually, that takes precedence. Otherwise, if they typed in an ID, that's used. If neither is provided, it defaults to no folder ID, often implying the root folder.
        *   **Type Conversion (`pageSize`):** The `pageSize` input is a text box in the UI, but the backend expects a number. The `params` function handles this conversion automatically using `Number.parseInt`.

By separating the UI definition (`subBlocks`) from the backend integration logic (`tools`) and using declarative conditions, this configuration creates a flexible, maintainable, and user-friendly way to interact with OneDrive within a larger application.
