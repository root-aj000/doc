This TypeScript file acts as the **schema definition** for a highly modular and extensible system, likely a visual workflow builder, automation platform, or an application that allows users to create custom "blocks" or components.

It defines all the fundamental types and interfaces necessary to describe:
*   The characteristics of a "block" (its name, category, description, icon, authentication).
*   How a block's user interface is constructed (the various input fields, selectors, and configuration options available).
*   The expected inputs and outputs of a block, including complex data structures and integrations with external "tools" or "triggers."
*   Advanced features like AI assistance for inputs, conditional rendering, and dependency management.

In essence, this file provides the "blueprints" for how blocks are defined, configured, and interact within the larger application.

### Detailed Explanation

Let's break down each part of the code:

#### Imports

```typescript
import type { JSX, SVGProps } from 'react'
import type { ToolResponse } from '@/tools/types'
```

*   `import type { JSX, SVGProps } from 'react'`: This line imports `JSX` and `SVGProps` types from the `react` library.
    *   `JSX.Element`: Represents a React element, which is what a React component typically returns to describe what should be rendered.
    *   `SVGProps<SVGSVGElement>`: A type that includes all standard HTML SVG attributes (like `width`, `height`, `fill`, `className`, `onClick`, etc.) that can be passed to an `<svg>` element in React. This is used for defining custom SVG icons.
*   `import type { ToolResponse } from '@/tools/types'`: This imports a type named `ToolResponse` from a module located at `src/tools/types`. This `ToolResponse` type likely defines the standardized structure of data returned by external "tools" or APIs that the blocks might interact with. The `type` keyword ensures these are imported only as types, not as runtime values, which helps with bundling and tree-shaking.

#### Type Definitions

```typescript
export type BlockIcon = (props: SVGProps<SVGSVGElement>) => JSX.Element
```

*   `export type BlockIcon = ...`: This defines a type alias `BlockIcon`.
*   It describes a function that takes a single argument, `props`, which is of type `SVGProps<SVGSVGElement>`. This means the function expects to receive standard SVG properties.
*   The function is expected to return a `JSX.Element`, meaning it's a React functional component designed to render an SVG icon. This ensures that all block icons conform to a consistent interface.

```typescript
export type ParamType = 'string' | 'number' | 'boolean' | 'json'
```

*   `export type ParamType = ...`: This defines a union type `ParamType`.
*   It specifies the fundamental data types that a block's *input parameters* can strictly be: a `string`, a `number`, a `boolean`, or `json` (representing a JavaScript object). This is used for defining the basic type of expected input values.

```typescript
export type PrimitiveValueType =
  | 'string'
  | 'number'
  | 'boolean'
  | 'json'
  | 'array'
  | 'files'
  | 'any'
```

*   `export type PrimitiveValueType = ...`: This defines another union type, `PrimitiveValueType`, which is broader than `ParamType`.
*   It includes the `ParamType` values (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, `json`) and adds `array`, `files` (likely for file uploads/selections), and `any` (a wildcard for unknown or flexible types). This type is more comprehensive and is often used to describe the types of *output values* or more general data types within the system.

```typescript
export type BlockCategory = 'blocks' | 'tools' | 'triggers'
```

*   `export type BlockCategory = ...`: This defines a union type `BlockCategory`.
*   It classifies blocks into distinct categories:
    *   `'blocks'`: General-purpose components.
    *   `'tools'`: Components that interact with external services or specific functionalities.
    *   `'triggers'`: Components that initiate workflows based on events.
*   This helps in organizing and displaying blocks in the user interface.

#### Enum Definition

```typescript
export enum AuthMode {
  OAuth = 'oauth',
  ApiKey = 'api_key',
  BotToken = 'bot_token',
}
```

*   `export enum AuthMode { ... }`: This defines a TypeScript string enum called `AuthMode`.
*   Enums provide a way to define a set of named constants. Here, it represents different authentication methods that a block or tool might support:
    *   `OAuth`: Standardized authorization framework.
    *   `ApiKey`: Simple key-based authentication.
    *   `BotToken`: Authentication often used for bot accounts in messaging platforms.
*   Using an enum makes the code more readable and prevents typos compared to using raw strings.

#### More Type Definitions

```typescript
export type GenerationType =
  | 'javascript-function-body'
  | 'typescript-function-body'
  // ... many more specific code/data generation types ...
  | 'mongodb-update'
```

*   `export type GenerationType = ...`: This is a very extensive union type that describes the various formats or languages for content that can be *generated* or *expected* by certain parts of the system.
*   It suggests that the system can handle, interpret, or generate snippets of different programming languages (JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL), data formats (JSON schema, JSON object), and even domain-specific queries or updates (PostgREST, MongoDB filters/pipelines/updates).
*   This type is critical for features like AI assistance (`wandConfig`) or code editor sub-blocks, indicating what kind of output they should produce or interpret.

```typescript
export type SubBlockType =
  | 'short-input' // Single line input
  | 'long-input' // Multi-line input
  // ... many more specific UI component types ...
  | 'input-mapping' // Map parent variables to child workflow input schema
```

*   `export type SubBlockType = ...`: This is another very long and important union type. It defines the specific *visual components* or *UI widgets* that can be used to configure a block's inputs or settings.
*   Think of these as the building blocks for the configuration form itself. Examples include:
    *   `short-input`, `long-input`: Text input fields.
    *   `dropdown`, `combobox`: Selection menus.
    *   `code`: A dedicated code editor.
    *   `file-selector`, `project-selector`, `channel-selector`: Specialized selectors for integrating with external services like Google Drive, Jira, Slack, etc.
    *   `oauth-input`, `webhook-config`, `trigger-config`: Configuration for integrations.
    *   `knowledge-base-selector`, `document-tag-entry`: Specific to knowledge management features.
    *   `mcp-server-selector`, `mcp-tool-selector`, `mcp-dynamic-args`: Likely "Multi-Cloud Platform" specific selectors.
    *   `input-mapping`: A UI component for visually mapping variables between different parts of a workflow.
*   The extensive list indicates a highly flexible and feature-rich UI construction system.

```typescript
export type SubBlockLayout = 'full' | 'half'
```

*   `export type SubBlockLayout = ...`: A simple union type defining possible layout options for `SubBlock` components.
    *   `'full'`: The sub-block takes the full available width.
    *   `'half'`: The sub-block takes half the available width, allowing two sub-blocks to sit side-by-side.

#### Utility Generic Types

```typescript
export type ExtractToolOutput<T> = T extends ToolResponse ? T['output'] : never
```

*   `export type ExtractToolOutput<T> = ...`: This is a conditional generic type.
*   It takes a type parameter `T`.
*   `T extends ToolResponse ? ... : never`: It checks if `T` can be assigned to `ToolResponse`.
    *   If `T` is a `ToolResponse` (or a more specific type that extends `ToolResponse`), it extracts the `output` property from `T`. This means if `ToolResponse` has a structure like `{ status: string; output: SomeType; }`, this utility type would give you `SomeType`.
    *   If `T` does *not* extend `ToolResponse`, the type becomes `never`, meaning it's an impossible or disallowed type in this context.
*   This is a powerful pattern for inferring and maintaining type safety when working with the output of `ToolResponse` objects, allowing you to easily get the specific data payload.

```typescript
export type ToolOutputToValueType<T> = T extends Record<string, any>
  ? {
      [K in keyof T]: T[K] extends string
        ? 'string'
        : T[K] extends number
          ? 'number'
          : T[K] extends boolean
            ? 'boolean'
            : T[K] extends object
              ? 'json'
              : 'any'
    }
  : never
```

*   `export type ToolOutputToValueType<T> = ...`: This is another powerful conditional and mapped generic type.
*   It takes a type parameter `T`.
*   `T extends Record<string, any> ? ... : never`: It first checks if `T` is an object (a `Record` where keys are strings and values can be anything).
    *   If it is an object, it then uses a **mapped type** (`[K in keyof T]`). This iterates over each key `K` in the type `T`.
    *   For each key `K`, it checks the type of `T[K]` (the value associated with that key) and maps it to one of our `PrimitiveValueType` strings:
        *   If `T[K]` is a `string`, it becomes the literal `'string'`.
        *   If `T[K]` is a `number`, it becomes `'number'`.
        *   If `T[K]` is a `boolean`, it becomes `'boolean'`.
        *   If `T[K]` is an `object`, it becomes `'json'`.
        *   Otherwise (for arrays, `null`, `undefined`, etc.), it defaults to `'any'`.
*   This utility type is used to dynamically generate a type that describes the *shape* of a tool's output object, but where each property's value is represented by its `PrimitiveValueType` string name. For example, if a tool outputs `{ name: string, age: number }`, this type would infer `{ name: 'string', age: 'number' }`. This is useful for describing an output's schema in a declarative way.

#### Block Output Definitions

```typescript
export type BlockOutput =
  | PrimitiveValueType
  | { [key: string]: PrimitiveValueType | Record<string, any> }
```

*   `export type BlockOutput = ...`: This defines the overall structure of data that a block can produce as its output.
*   A block's output can be either:
    *   A single `PrimitiveValueType` (e.g., just a string, number, or boolean).
    *   An object (`{ [key: string]: ... }`) where each key maps to either a `PrimitiveValueType` or even another nested object (`Record<string, any>`). This allows for complex, structured outputs.

```typescript
export type OutputFieldDefinition =
  | PrimitiveValueType
  | { type: PrimitiveValueType; description?: string }
```

*   `export type OutputFieldDefinition = ...`: This type is used to define *individual fields* within a block's output schema.
*   An output field can be:
    *   A `PrimitiveValueType` directly (e.g., `'string'`, `'number'`).
    *   An object with a `type` property (which is a `PrimitiveValueType`) and an optional `description` string. This allows adding metadata to explain what each output field represents.

#### Interface Definitions

```typescript
export interface ParamConfig {
  type: ParamType
  description?: string
  schema?: {
    type: string
    properties: Record<string, any>
    required?: string[]
    additionalProperties?: boolean
    items?: {
      type: string
      properties?: Record<string, any>
      required?: string[]
      additionalProperties?: boolean
    }
  }
}
```

*   `export interface ParamConfig { ... }`: This interface describes the configuration for a *single input parameter* of a block.
    *   `type: ParamType`: The basic data type of the parameter (string, number, boolean, json).
    *   `description?: string`: An optional explanatory text for the parameter.
    *   `schema?: { ... }`: An optional property to provide a JSON Schema definition for more complex parameters, especially for `json` or `array` types. This allows for detailed validation and structure definition of the parameter's value.
        *   `type`: The overall JSON Schema type (e.g., `'object'`, `'array'`).
        *   `properties`: Defines expected fields and their types if `type` is `'object'`.
        *   `required`: An array of property names that are mandatory.
        *   `additionalProperties`: Whether properties not explicitly listed are allowed.
        *   `items`: If `type` is `'array'`, this defines the schema for elements within the array.

```typescript
export interface SubBlockConfig {
  id: string
  title?: string
  type: SubBlockType
  layout?: SubBlockLayout
  mode?: 'basic' | 'advanced' | 'both' // Default is 'both' if not specified
  canonicalParamId?: string

  step?: number // for slider
  integer?: boolean // for slider
  rows?: number // for long input
  multiSelect?: boolean // for multi-select dropdowns
  wandConfig?: { // AI assistance feature
    enabled: boolean
    prompt: string
    generationType?: GenerationType
    placeholder?: string
    maintainHistory?: boolean
  }
  availableTriggers?: string[] // for trigger configuration
  triggerProvider?: string // for trigger configuration
  dependsOn?: string[] // Declarative dependency hints
}
```

*   `export interface SubBlockConfig { ... }`: **This is a large and critical interface!** It defines the configuration for each individual UI component (`SubBlockType`) that appears in a block's settings or input panel.
    *   `id: string`: A unique identifier for this particular sub-block (e.g., `email_subject_input`).
    *   `title?: string`: The display label for the sub-block (e.g., "Email Subject").
    *   `type: SubBlockType`: Specifies *what kind* of UI component this sub-block is (e.g., `'short-input'`, `'dropdown'`, `'code'`).
    *   `layout?: SubBlockLayout`: How the sub-block should be laid out (`'full'` or `'half'` width).
    *   `mode?: 'basic' | 'advanced' | 'both'`: Controls visibility, allowing sub-blocks to be hidden in "basic" mode and only shown in "advanced" settings.
    *   `canonicalParamId?: string`: If this sub-block is responsible for setting a value for a main `ParamConfig` of the block, this links it to that parameter's ID.
    *   `required?: boolean`: Indicates if the input is mandatory.
    *   `defaultValue?: ...`: A default value for the input.
    *   `options?: ...`: For `dropdown` or `combobox` types, this provides the list of choices. It can be a static array or a function that returns the array dynamically.
    *   `min?`, `max?`: For number inputs (`slider`).
    *   `columns?`: For `table` type sub-blocks.
    *   `placeholder?`: Placeholder text for input fields.
    *   `password?`: For sensitive input fields.
    *   `connectionDroppable?`: Indicates if a connection (e.g., from another block's output) can be dropped onto this input.
    *   `hidden?`: Whether the sub-block should be hidden entirely.
    *   `description?`: Additional help text for the sub-block.
    *   `value?: (params: Record<string, any>) => string`: A function that can dynamically compute the sub-block's value based on the current values of other parameters in the block.
    *   `grouped?`, `scrollable?`, `maxHeight?`, `selectAllOption?`: Specific options for list-based sub-blocks like `checkbox-list`.
    *   `condition?: ...`: **Conditional rendering logic!** This is very powerful. It defines when this sub-block should be visible based on the value of another field (`field`) within the same block. It can also include `not` and `and` operators for more complex conditions. It can be a static object or a function that dynamically returns the condition.
    *   **Properties specific to `code` type:** `language`, `generationType`.
    *   **Properties specific to `oauth-input` type:** `provider`, `serviceId`, `requiredScopes`.
    *   **Properties specific to `file-selector` / `file-upload` types:** `mimeType`, `acceptedTypes`, `multiple`, `maxSize`.

    *   **Properties specific to `long-input` type:** `rows`.
    *   `multiSelect?`: For dropdowns that allow multiple selections.
    *   `wandConfig?: { ... }`: **AI assistance feature!** This enables an "AI wand" or generative AI helper for this specific input field. It includes:
        *   `enabled`: Turn the feature on/off.
        *   `prompt`: A custom prompt template for the AI to generate content.
        *   `generationType`: Optional specific `GenerationType` for the AI output.
        *   `placeholder`: Custom placeholder for the AI prompt input.
        *   `maintainHistory`: Whether the AI should remember previous interactions.
    *   **Properties specific to `trigger-config` type:** `availableTriggers`, `triggerProvider`.
    *   `dependsOn?: string[]`: A list of IDs of other input fields this sub-block depends on. If one of these dependency fields changes, this sub-block's value might be reset or invalidated, providing smart form behavior.

```typescript
export interface BlockConfig<T extends ToolResponse = ToolResponse> {
  type: string
  name: string
  description: string
  category: BlockCategory
  longDescription?: string
  bestPractices?: string
  docsLink?: string
  bgColor: string
  icon: BlockIcon
  subBlocks: SubBlockConfig[]
  triggerAllowed?: boolean
  authMode?: AuthMode
  tools: {
    access: string[]
    config?: {
      tool: (params: Record<string, any>) => string
      params?: (params: Record<string, any>) => Record<string, any>
    }
  }
  inputs: Record<string, ParamConfig>
  outputs: Record<string, OutputFieldDefinition> & {
    visualization?: {
      type: 'image'
      url: string
    }
  }
  hideFromToolbar?: boolean
  triggers?: {
    enabled: boolean
    available: string[] // List of trigger IDs this block supports
  }
}
```

*   `export interface BlockConfig<T extends ToolResponse = ToolResponse> { ... }`: **This is the main interface defining an entire block!** It uses a generic type `T` which defaults to `ToolResponse`, allowing for specific tool response types to be passed in if needed.
    *   `type: string`: A unique identifier string for the block type (e.g., `'send_email_block'`, `'read_csv_block'`).
    *   `name: string`: The display name of the block (e.g., "Send Email").
    *   `description: string`: A short summary of what the block does.
    *   `category: BlockCategory`: The category this block belongs to (`'blocks'`, `'tools'`, `'triggers'`).
    *   `longDescription?: string`, `bestPractices?: string`, `docsLink?: string`: Optional fields for more detailed documentation and guidance.
    *   `bgColor: string`, `icon: BlockIcon`: Styling and visual representation of the block in the UI.
    *   `subBlocks: SubBlockConfig[]`: **An array of `SubBlockConfig` objects.** This is the critical link! It defines the entire configuration form for this block, specifying all the input fields, selectors, and other UI elements the user interacts with.
    *   `triggerAllowed?: boolean`: Indicates if this block can be used as a trigger for a workflow.
    *   `authMode?: AuthMode`: Specifies the authentication method required for this block to operate, if any.
    *   `tools: { ... }`: **Integration with external tools/APIs!**
        *   `access: string[]`: A list of tool IDs or names this block needs permission to access.
        *   `config?: { ... }`: An optional configuration for how this block interacts with a specific tool:
            *   `tool: (params: Record<string, any>) => string`: A function that dynamically determines *which* tool to call based on the block's current parameters. It returns the tool's ID.
            *   `params?: (params: Record<string, any>) => Record<string, any>`: A function that dynamically maps the block's internal parameters to the specific parameters expected by the external tool. This is essential for abstracting tool specifics from the block's interface.
    *   `inputs: Record<string, ParamConfig>`: Defines all the *logical input parameters* for the block. The keys are parameter IDs (e.g., `'to_address'`, `'email_body'`), and the values are `ParamConfig` objects, detailing their types and schemas. Note that `subBlocks` define the *UI elements* for these inputs, while `inputs` defines the *data contract*.
    *   `outputs: Record<string, OutputFieldDefinition> & { visualization?: { ... } }`: Defines all the *logical output fields* produced by the block. The keys are output field IDs (e.g., `'status'`, `'processed_data'`), and values are `OutputFieldDefinition` objects.
        *   `visualization?: { type: 'image'; url: string; }`: An optional property to provide a URL for an image-based visualization of the block's output, useful for displaying results in a graphical way.
    *   `hideFromToolbar?: boolean`: If true, this block won't appear in the main toolbar or palette for users to select.
    *   `triggers?: { ... }`: Configuration if this block *itself* acts as a source of triggers (e.g., "When a new file is uploaded to this block...").
        *   `enabled`: Whether triggering functionality is active.
        *   `available`: A list of specific trigger IDs that this block supports (e.g., `'on_file_upload'`, `'on_data_change'`).

```typescript
export interface OutputConfig {
  type: BlockOutput
}
```

*   `export interface OutputConfig { ... }`: A simpler interface that wraps the `BlockOutput` type. It has a single property `type` which is of type `BlockOutput`. This might be used in contexts where an output is always expected to be described within an object, even if `BlockOutput` itself can sometimes be a primitive. It provides a consistent object structure.

### Simplified Complex Logic

The most complex parts are the rich union types (`GenerationType`, `SubBlockType`), the generic utility types (`ExtractToolOutput`, `ToolOutputToValueType`), and the `SubBlockConfig` and `BlockConfig` interfaces.

1.  **Massive Union Types (`GenerationType`, `SubBlockType`):**
    *   **Simple Explanation:** Imagine you're building a LEGO set, but instead of just bricks, you have *hundreds* of specialized LEGO pieces: a door with a handle, a specific window, a control panel with buttons, a tiny computer screen, a piece that generates electricity, etc. `SubBlockType` is the list of *all possible specialized LEGO pieces you can use to build a block's settings screen*. `GenerationType` is a list of *all the different kinds of things those pieces can generate* (like a JavaScript snippet, a database query, or a JSON object). The long lists just mean the system is incredibly versatile and can handle many different scenarios.

2.  **Generic Utility Types (`ExtractToolOutput`, `ToolOutputToValueType`):**
    *   **Simple Explanation:** These are like smart translators.
        *   `ExtractToolOutput`: If you tell the system, "Here's a `ToolResponse` object that includes output data," this type *automatically figures out the exact type of that output data* for you, without you having to manually specify it. It's like having a smart assistant who, when given a wrapped gift (the `ToolResponse`), knows exactly what's inside (the `output`) without you saying it explicitly.
        *   `ToolOutputToValueType`: If a tool outputs complex data like `{ name: "Alice", age: 30 }`, this type transforms that into a description like `{ name: 'string', age: 'number' }`. It's like taking a detailed picture of something and then making a simplified sketch that just labels the main components and their basic categories. This is useful for describing an output's schema declaratively.

3.  **`SubBlockConfig` (UI Element Definition):**
    *   **Simple Explanation:** This is the instruction manual for *each individual input field, dropdown, or special widget* you see on a block's configuration screen. It specifies its name (`title`), its type (e.g., `short-input`), if it's required, what options it has, if it needs a password, and even advanced behaviors like "only show this field if another field has a certain value" (`condition`) or "help me write this with AI" (`wandConfig`). It's a comprehensive blueprint for building interactive forms.

4.  **`BlockConfig` (Full Block Definition):**
    *   **Simple Explanation:** This is the master blueprint for an *entire block*. It brings everything together. It defines the block's overall identity (`name`, `description`, `icon`), how it looks and behaves in the workflow (`category`, `bgColor`), all the individual configuration elements the user sees (`subBlocks`), what actual data it expects as input (`inputs`), what data it produces as output (`outputs`), and how it talks to other services (`tools`, `authMode`). It's the central definition that allows the system to understand and operate each block. The `tools` property is especially clever, allowing a block to dynamically choose *which* external tool to call and *how* to prepare the data for that call.

This file creates a robust and flexible framework for defining modular, configurable, and interactive components within a sophisticated application.
